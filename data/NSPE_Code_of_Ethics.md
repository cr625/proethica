## Note on Competitive Bidding

By court order, NSPE no longer prohibits competitive bidding. Engineers may freely provide pricing, and this does not override federal, state, or local procurement rules. NSPE members may also seek legislation to support professional selection procedures.  

**Clarifications**:

1. Engineers may choose not to bid.  
2. Clients are not required to seek bids.  
3. Public procurement laws remain valid.  
4. Chapters may pursue professional negotiation laws.  
5. State boards may enforce non-bidding ethics rules.  
6. NSPE members may advocate for government policies.

**Application**: The Code applies to individual engineers, regardless of corporate structure, who are responsible for ethical professional conduct.
