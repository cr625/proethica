Engineer A learns that \u201cTransportation Engineer\u201d B is neither a licensed engineer nor even a degreed engineer. Engineer A is concerned that the State Agency has given staff in management positions the title of \u201cEngineer\u201d when they are not qualified to review and approve consulting engineers\u2019 design documents.\n\nIs it ethical for \u201cTransportation Engineer\u201d B to engage in the practice of engineering when \u201cTrans\u0002portation Engineer\u201d B is not qualified for licensure based on education, examination, and experience?\nIf \u201cTransportation Engineer\u201d B is practicing engineering, does Engineer A have an obligation to re\u0002port \u201cTransportation Engineer\u201d B for the unlicensed practice?\n\nIs it ethical for \u201cTransportation Engineer\u201d B to engage in the practice of engineering when \u201cTrans\u0002portation Engineer\u201d B is not qualified for licensure based on education, examination, and experience?\n\nIf \u201cTransportation Engineer\u201d B is practicing engineering, does Engineer A have an obligation to re\u0002port \u201cTransportation Engineer\u201d B for the unlicensed practice?\n\nLicensing requirements are imposed upon highly skilled professional occupations such as medicine, law, and engineering. These requirements protect the public interest by ensuring members of the profession have demonstrated acceptable levels of competence and expertise and by excluding unqualified individuals who might misrepresent their skills and abilities to take advantage of the unsuspecting public.\n\nThere are ethical concerns when unqualified individuals engage in the practice of engineering. Performance of engineering services by unqualified individuals is detrimental to public safety and to the integrity of the engineering profession at large. Use of the title, \u201cengineer,\u201d conveys substantial education, examination, and experience, and, in many states, a license to practice. \u201cEngineer\u201d titles used by individuals working for state agencies tends to convey the impression that they are licensed professional engineers, which may cause confusion among the public. Use of creative titles such as \u201cAssociate Engineer,\u201d \u201cBuilding Engineer,\u201d \u201cForest Practices Engineer\u201d and \u201cSanitation Engineer\u201d misrepresents qualifications. Unqualified individuals providing these services when they are not under the direct personal supervision of a licensed professional engineer have caused harm to the public health, safety, and welfare.\n\nThe Board of Ethical Review has had the opportunity to review similar cases. In BER Case 92-2, an engineer intern (EI) observed that the firm\u2019s advertising documents listed him as a PE. The EI reported this misrepresentation to the marketing department, but after six months, the documents had not been corrected. The BER noted that the EI took the appropriate step by alerting the marketing director of the error and concluded that \u201c[w]hile there is no indication that what has occurred under these facts is anything other than a negligent oversight, continued inaction by the firm in light of actual knowledge of the error could easily raise questions of improper and unethical conduct.\u201d\n\nBER Case 95-10 considered an engineering firm, ENGCO, that listed key personnel who did not hold engineering degrees with titles including \u201cEngineer\u201d and \u201cDesign Engineer.\u201d The case discussion indicated that \u201cAlthough the industry and governmental agencies sometimes use the term indiscriminently [sic], we in the profession must not.\u201d This case also suggested that most states have in their state licensing act how and when the word \u201cengineer\u201d can be used in a title, usually requiring a college degree and/or meeting licensing requirements, but it went on to point out that when \u201cnon-degreed personnel have fulfilled the state requirements to be licensed, they may use the term regardless of their formal education.\u201d It should be noted that in the present case, NSPE Code of Ethics Section II.5.a. is very clear: \u201cEngineers shall not falsify their qualifications or permit misrepresentation of their or their associates\u2019 qualifications. They shall not misrepresent or exaggerate their responsibility in or for the subject matter of prior assignments.\u201d In light of the fact that Engineer A has been directed to revise his \u201csigned and sealed contract documents\u201d based on [non] Engineer B\u2019s review, Engineer A is working in association with B. Per Section II.1.e, Engineer A \u201cshall not aid or abet the unlawful practice of engineering\u2026\u201d and is obligated to report Engineer B\u2019s violation to appropriate professional bodies (Section II.1.f). Professional engineers owe ethical duties to the public that unlicensed individuals merely holding the title of \u201cEngineer\u201d do not owe. Professional engineers are personally and legally responsible for their services and must comply with a professional code of ethics. Allowing unlicensed individuals to hold themselves out as \u201cEngineers\u201d with none of the associated ethical or legal obligations diminishes the profession and endangers the public by posing a significant threat to public health and safety. This clearly undermines both the public\u2019s confidence in the profession and the intent of licensure that professional engineers adhere to minimum standards and technical competence obtained through significant education and practical experience as evidenced by successful completion of a rigorous examination.\n\nPreamble\n\nEngineering is an important and learned profession. As members of this profession, engineers are expected to exhibit the highest standards of honesty and integrity. Engineering has a direct and vital impact on the quality of life for all people. Accordingly, the services provided by engineers require honesty, impartiality, fairness, and equity, and must be dedicated to the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare. Engineers must perform under a standard of professional behavior that requires adherence to the highest principles of ethical conduct.\n\nI.1.\n\nHold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public.\n\nII.1.e.\n\nEngineers shall not aid or abet the unlawful practice of engineering by a person or firm.\n\nII.1.f.\n\nEngineers having knowledge of any alleged violation of this Code shall report thereon to appropriate professional bodies and, when relevant, also to public authorities, and cooperate with the proper authorities in furnishing such information or assistance as may be required.\n\nII.5.a.\n\nEngineers shall not falsify their qualifications or permit misrepresentation of their or their associates' qualifications. They shall not misrepresent or exaggerate their responsibility in or for the subject matter of prior assignments. Brochures or other presentations incident to the solicitation of employment shall not misrepresent pertinent facts concerning employers, employees, associates, joint venturers, or past accomplishments.\n\nIII.8.a.\n\nEngineers shall conform with state registration laws in the practice of engineering.\n\nIt is unlawful and therefore not ethical for \u201cTransportation Engineer\u201d B to engage in the practice of engineering without having fulfilled the requirements for licensure: adequate education, rigorous examination, and substantial experience.\nSince \u201cTransportation Engineer\u201d B is practicing engineering (as defined by the state in question), Engineer A has an obligation to report \u201cTransportation Engineer\u201d B for unlicensed practice.\n\nIt is unlawful and therefore not ethical for \u201cTransportation Engineer\u201d B to engage in the practice of engineering without having fulfilled the requirements for licensure: adequate education, rigorous examination, and substantial experience.\n\nSince \u201cTransportation Engineer\u201d B is practicing engineering (as defined by the state in question), Engineer A has an obligation to report \u201cTransportation Engineer\u201d B for unlicensed practice.",
