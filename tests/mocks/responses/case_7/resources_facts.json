This is the Rs component of the formal specification D=(R,P,O,S,Rs,A,E,Ca,Cs).\n- Resource Constrained: Resource limitation affecting available actions\n- Resource Constraint: Limitations on available time, budget, materials, or human resources (Ganascia 2007)\n- Resource Type: Meta-class for specific resource types recognized by the ProEthica system\n- Resources Available: Resource sufficiency enabling full options\n\nIMPORTANT: Only extract NEW resource types not listed above!\n\n\nYou are analyzing a professional ethics case to extract both RESOURCE CLASSES and RESOURCE INSTANCES.\n\nDEFINITIONS:\n- RESOURCE CLASS: A type of document, tool, standard, or knowledge source (e.g., \"Emergency Response Protocol\", \"Technical Specification\", \"Ethics Code\")\n- RESOURCE INDIVIDUAL: A specific instance of a resource used in this case (e.g., \"NSPE Code of Ethics 2023\", \"City M Water Quality Standards\")\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Every RESOURCE CLASS you identify MUST be based on at least one specific RESOURCE INDIVIDUAL instance in the case.\nYou cannot propose a resource class without providing the concrete instance(s) that demonstrate it.\n\nYOUR TASK - Extract two LINKED types of entities:\n\n1. NEW RESOURCE CLASSES (types not in the existing ontology above):\n   - Novel types of resources discovered in this case\n   - Must be sufficiently general to apply to other cases\n   - Should represent distinct categories of decision-making resources\n   - Consider documents, tools, standards, guidelines, databases, etc.\n\n2. RESOURCE INDIVIDUALS (specific instances in this case):\n   - Specific documents, tools, or knowledge sources mentioned\n   - MUST have identifiable titles or descriptions\n   - Include metadata (creator, date, version) where available\n   - Map to existing classes where possible, or to new classes you discover\n\nEXTRACTION GUIDELINES:\n\nFor NEW RESOURCE CLASSES, identify:\n- Label: Clear, professional name for the resource type\n- Definition: What this resource type represents\n- Resource type: document, tool, standard, guideline, database, etc.\n- Accessibility: public, restricted, proprietary, etc.\n- Authority source: Who typically creates/maintains these resources\n- Typical usage: How these resources are typically used\n- Domain context: Medical/Engineering/Legal/etc.\n- Examples from case: Specific instances showing this resource type\n\nFor RESOURCE INDIVIDUALS, identify:\n- Identifier: Unique descriptor (e.g., \"NSPE_CodeOfEthics_2023\")\n- Resource class: Which resource type it represents (existing or new)\n- Document title: Official name or description\n- Created by: Organization or authority that created it\n- Created at: When it was created (if mentioned)\n- Version: Edition or version information\n- URL or location: Where to find it (if mentioned)\n- Used by: Who used this resource in the case\n- Used in context: How this resource was applied\n- Case involvement: How this resource affected decisions\n\nCASE TEXT FROM facts SECTION:\nEngineer A, an environmental engineer with several years of experience and holding a professional engineering license, was retained by Client W to prepare a comprehensive report addressing the manufacture, use, and characteristics of an organic compound identified as an emerging contaminant of concern. This work required Engineer A to perform an analysis of groundwater monitoring data from a site Engineer A had been observing for over a year. In addition, Engineer A was tasked to develop engineering design documents (plans and specifications) for modifications to groundwater infrastructure at the same site.\nEngineer A is known for their strong technical expertise but is, personally, less confident in their technical writing. Previously, Engineer A had relied on guidance and quality assurance reviews by their mentor and supervisor, Engineer B, to refine report drafts. But Engineer B recently retired and was no longer available to Engineer A in a work capacity.\nFaced with the need to deliver both the report and the engineering design documents without the review by and mentorship from Engineer B, Engineer A opted to use open-sourced artificial intelligence (AI) software to create an initial draft of the necessary report and to use AI-assisted drafting tools to generate preliminary design documents. The AI drafting software was new to the market and Engineer A had no previous experience with the tool. The AI drafting software was also open-sourced.\nFor the report, Engineer A gathered the relevant information provided by Client W and relied on the AI software to synthesize the information and generate an initial draft of the necessary report. Engineer A input the information gathered from Client W into the AI software, and, after a few refining prompts, received a first draft of the report generated by the AI software.\nNot being familiar with the full functionality of the AI software, including the accuracy and originality of AI-generated text, Engineer A conducted a thorough review of the report, cross-checking key facts against professional journal articles and verifying the phrasing by running search engine queries to ensure the content did not match any existing language. Engineer A also made minor adjustments to some of the wording to personalize the content. Engineer A did not cite their use of AI-software or its large language models, and submitted the draft report to Client W for review, including language to clearly identify that the supplied report was a draft, but applied their seal consistent with state law.\nFor the engineering design documents, Engineer A entered the information gathered from Client W into the AI software and relied on the AI-assisted drafting tools to generate a preliminary design of the plans, including basic layouts and technical specifications. Engineer A completed a cursory review of the AI-generated plans and adjusted certain elements to align with site-specific conditions. Again, Engineer A did not cite the AI-assisted drafting tools they used to generate the engineering design documents.\nWhen Client W reviewed the draft report, Client W noted that the section analyzing the groundwater monitoring data would benefit from minor edits for grammar and clarity, but found the introduction discussing the contaminant’s manufacture, use, and characteristics to be exceptionally polished. The Client commented that the report read as if written by two different authors but was otherwise satisfactory. Client W, however, noticed several issues with the AI-generated design documents, including misaligned dimensions and an omission of key safety features required by local regulations. Client W raised concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the engineering design and instructed Engineer A to revise the plans, ensuring that all elements satisfied the necessary professional and regulatory standards.\n\nRespond with a JSON structure.
