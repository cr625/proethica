  "prompt": "You are an expert in professional ethics analyzing a case for obligations (professional duties and requirements).\n\nBased on the literature:\n- Obligations are CONCRETE PROFESSIONAL DUTIES derived from abstract principles (Hallamaa & Kalliokoski 2022)\n- They specify what professionals MUST, SHOULD, or MUST NOT do (Dennis et al. 2016)\n- Obligations have deontic force and are enforceable (Wooldridge & Jennings 1995)\n- They operationalize principles in specific contexts (Kong et al. 2020)\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Identify NEW OBLIGATION CLASSES not in the existing ontology\n2. Extract SPECIFIC OBLIGATION INDIVIDUALS from the case\n\n\nEXISTING OBLIGATIONS IN ONTOLOGY (check if your identified obligations match these before creating new classes):\n- Attribution Obligation: Duty to properly cite and acknowledge all sources, tools, and methods used in creating professional deliverables\n- Collegial Obligation: Duties toward professional peers including respect, fairness, and credit for work\n- Competence Obligation: Requirement to perform services only in areas of competence (NSPE II.2)\n- Conditional Obligation: Obligations that apply only when specific conditions are met\n- Confidentiality Obligation: Duty to protect confidential information of clients or employers (NSPE III.4)\n- Defeasible Obligation: Obligations that admit justified exceptions under specified conditions (Ganascia 2007)\n- Disclosure Obligation: Requirement to inform stakeholders about conflicts, limitations, or risks (NSPE II.3.a)\n- Ethical Obligation: Obligations arising from ethical principles beyond legal requirements\n- Legal Obligation: Obligations arising from legal requirements and regulations\n- Mandatory Obligation: Obligations that MUST be fulfilled (deontic force: mandatory)\n- Obligation: An information content entity expressing required actions or behaviors in professional contexts. This is the O component of the formal specification D=(R,P,O,S,Rs,A,E,Ca,Cs).\n- Prima Facie Obligation: Obligations that hold at first appearance but may be overridden by stronger duties (Anderson & Anderson)\n- Professional Obligation: A duty or responsibility arising from professional role or standards\n- Quality Assurance Obligation: Requirement to implement appropriate review and verification processes for all professional deliverables before submission\n- Reporting Obligation: Duty to report violations or unsafe conditions to appropriate authorities\n- Responsible Charge Obligation: Duty to maintain active engagement and personal decision-making authority throughout engineering process from conception to completion\n- Safety Obligation: Duty to hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public (NSPE I.1)\n- Technology Competence Obligation: Requirement to understand and verify the capabilities, limitations, and risks of technological tools used in professional practice\n- Technology Verification Obligation: Requirement to thoroughly verify and validate outputs from technological tools including AI before incorporating them into professional work\n\n\nAnalyze this discussion section:\n\nThe Board of Ethical Review (BER) has a long history of open and welcome advocacy for the introduction of new technologies in engineering work, so long as the technologies are used in such a way that the engineering is done professionally. Artificial intelligence (AI) language processing software and AI-assisted drafting tools are in this category. The AI issues examined in this case are characteristic of engineering practice and are discussed and analyzed accordingly. However, other ethical considerations may arise when applying AI in different engineering contexts such as engineering education or engineering research. The following discussion does not attempt to address any of the potential legal considerations that may arise in such circumstances.\nAlmost 35 years ago, in BER Case 90-6 , the BER looked at a hypothetical involving an engineer’s use of computer assisted drafting and design tools. The BER was asked if it was ethical for an engineer to sign and seal documents prepared using such a system. The introductory paragraph in that case gives a nice summary of the issue and looks ahead to one of the questions we see in this case – use of AI. The case begins:\nIn recent years, the engineering profession has been ‘revolutionized’ by exponential growth in new and innovative computer technological breakthroughs. None have been more dynamic than the evolution that transformed yesterday's manual design techniques to Computer Aided Design (CAD), thence to Computer Assisted Drafting and Design (CADD) and soon Artificial Intelligence [AI]. The BER considers the change to CAD to merely represent a drafting enhancement. The change to CADD provides the BER with concerns that require assurance that the professional engineer has the requisite background, education and training to be proficient with the dynamics of CADD including the limitations of current technology. As night follows day one can be assured that CADD utilized beyond its ability to serve as a valuable tool has a propensity to be utilized as a crutch or substitute for judgement. That translates to a scenario for potential liability.\nIn BER Case 90-6 , the BER determined that it was ethical for an engineer to sign and seal documents that were created using a CADD system whether prepared by the engineer themselves or by other engineers working under their direction and control.\nThe use of AI in engineering practice raises ethical considerations, particularly concerning competency, direction and control, respect for client privacy, and accurate and appropriate attribution. Culminating in the key question: Is using AI adding a new tool to an engineer’s toolbox, or is it something more?\nFundamental Canon I.2 states that engineers “perform services only in areas of their competence” and Code section II.2.a states that engineers must “undertake assignments only when qualified by education or experience in the specific technical fields involved.” Here, Engineer A, as an experienced environmental engineer, was competent to analyze groundwater monitoring data and assess contaminant risks. Because Engineer A performed a thorough review, cross-checked key facts against professional sources, and made adjustments to the text, the final document remained under Engineer A’s direction and control, as required by Code section II.2.b, “[e]ngineers shall not affix their signatures to any plans or documents . . . not prepared under their direction and control.”\nFurther, the use of AI to assist with writing does not inherently constitute deception. Engineer A did not misrepresent their qualifications or technical expertise, nor did the AI-generated text contain inaccuracies. Fundamental Canon I.5 requires an Engineer to “avoid deceptive acts,” which was not violated here. Finally, Engineer A performed a thorough review and cross-checked the work on the report, much like Engineer A would have likely done if the report had been initially drafted by an engineer intern or other support staff.\nPer Code section II.1.c, confidential information can only be shared with prior consent of the Client. While careful review and checking of AI-generated content was consistent for ethical use, this does not end the inquiry into Engineer A’s actions. When Engineer A uploaded Client W’s information into the AI open-source interface, this was tantamount to placing the Client’s private information in the public domain. The facts here do not indicate Engineer A obtained permission from Client W to use the private information in the public domain. Similarly, the facts do not indicate the AI-generated report included citations of pertinent documents of technical authority. Per Code section III.9, engineers are required to “give credit for engineering work to those to whom credit is due,” so Engineer A’s ethical use of the AI software would need to include appropriate citations. Absent this professional level of care, diligence, and documentation, Engineer A’s use of the AI language processing software would be less than ethical.\nIn addition to using AI to prepare the report, Engineer A also prepared draft design documents with a AI-assisted drafting tool that was new to the market. Engineer A elected to only conduct a high-level review and adjusted certain elements to align with site-specific conditions. When Client W reviewed the design documents, they found misaligned dimensions and key safety features (including those necessary for compliance with local regulations) were omitted.\nTurning to the omission of key safety features in the AI-generated plans, the BER looked at a similar situation previously. BER Case 98-3 discussed a solicitation by mail for engineers to use new technology to help gain more work. The solicitation read “Now - - thanks to a revolutionary new CD-ROM - specifying, designing and costing out any construction project is as easy as pointing and clicking your mouse - no matter your design experience. For instance, never designed a highway before? No problem. Just point to the ‘Highways’ window and click.” The engineer in BER Case 98-3 ordered the CD-ROM and began offering facilities design and construction services despite having no experience in this area or with the software. In its discussion in BER Case 98-3 , the BER reviewed several cases involving engineering competency, and concluded it would be unethical for an engineer to offer facilities design and construction services using a tool like this CD-ROM based on the facts presented in the case. They noted:\nIn closing, the [BER]’s decision should not be understood as a wholesale rejection of the use of computers, CD-ROMs and other technological advances. Rather, it is the [BER]’s position that technology has an important place in the practice of engineering, but it must never be a replacement of a substitute for engineering judgment.\nThus, Engineer A’s approach to reviewing AI-generated engineering designs presents greater ethical concerns than the ultimate use of AI for report writing. While AI-assisted drafting can be beneficial, the identified errors suggest insufficient review, which could compromise public welfare and impinge on Engineer A’s ethical and professional obligations.\nTo begin, it is the BER’s view that under the facts, unlike the situation of BER Case 98-3 , Engineer A is not incompetent. The facts specifically note Engineer A has “several years of experience” and “strong technical expertise.” But the facts also note Engineer A appears to be operating in a compromised manner – namely, without the help of Engineer B – such that Engineer A relied on the AI-generated plans and specifications without proper oversight.\nCode section II.2.b states that, “[e]ngineers shall not affix their signatures to any plans or documents dealing with subject matter in which they lack competence, nor to any plan or document not prepared under their direction and control.” By relying on AI-assisted tools without a comprehensive verification process of its output, Engineer A risked violating this requirement. Furthermore, failure to detect misaligned dimensions and omitted safety features further indicates that Engineer A did not exercise sufficient diligence. The errors in the AI-generated design documents could have led to regulatory noncompliance and safety hazards, conflicting with the Fundamental Canon I.1, “hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public”.\nEngineer A’s oversight of engineering plans was inadequate, raising ethical concerns. AI-generated technical work requires at least the same level of scrutiny as human-created work. Engineer A did not maintain responsible charge in violation of licensure law which violates Code section III.8.a. NSPE defines “Responsible Charge” in NSPE Position Statement No. 10-1778 as “being actively engaged in the engineering process, from conception to completion. Engineering decisions must be personally made by the professional engineer or by others over which the professional engineer provides supervisory direction and control authority. Reviewing drawings or documents after preparation without involvement in the design and development process does not satisfy the definition of Responsible Charge.”\nEngineer A, as the engineer in Responsible Charge of the project, is required to provide an experienced-based quality assurance review, engaging in critical discussions, mentorship, and professional development—elements that AI cannot replicate. The BER notes that in BER Case 98-3 , the BER stated that technology must not replace or be used as a substitute for engineering judgement. Much like directing an engineering intern to solve a problem, responsible use of AI requires an engineer to outline solution guidelines and constraints. Recommendations from the program or intern should not be blindly accepted, they should be considered and challenged and the resulting outputs should be understood. Only after the engineer in Responsible Charge has satisfied themselves that the proposed solution is in accordance with their own and professional standards should the design/report be accepted. These are steps that, in this case, Engineer A chose not to follow.\nWhile Engineer A reviewed the content, the lack of disclosure raises concerns about transparency. BER Case 98-3 emphasized that engineers must acknowledge significant contributions by others. AI, while not a human contributor, fundamentally shaped the report and design documents, warranting disclosure under Code section III.9, “[e]ngineers shall give credit for engineering work to those to whom credit is due, and will recognize the proprietary interests of others.”\nThere are currently no universal guidelines mandating AI disclosure in engineering work, but best practices suggest informing clients when AI substantially contributes to a work product. Given that Client W identified issues in the engineering design and questioned inconsistencies in the report, proactive disclosure could have prevented misunderstandings and strengthened trust.\n\nExtract obligations following this JSON structure:\n\n{\n  \"new_obligation_classes\": [\n    {\n      \"label\": \"Clear, specific obligation class name\",\n      \"definition\": \"What this type of obligation requires professionals to do\",\n      \"derived_from_principle\": \"Which principle this operationalizes (e.g., 'Public Safety', 'Honesty')\",\n      \"duty_type\": \"professional|legal|ethical|societal\",\n      \"enforcement_mechanism\": \"How this obligation is typically enforced\",\n      \"violation_consequences\": \"What happens when this obligation is violated\",\n      \"examples_from_case\": [\"Example 1 from the case\", \"Example 2\"],\n      \"source_text\": \"EXACT text snippet from case where this obligation is identified (max 200 characters)\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.0-1.0,\n      \"reasoning\": \"Why this is a new class not in existing ontology\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"obligation_individuals\": [\n    {\n      \"identifier\": \"Unique name for this specific obligation instance\",\n      \"obligation_class\": \"Name of the obligation class (new or existing)\",\n      \"obligated_party\": \"Who has this obligation (e.g., 'Engineer L', 'All Licensed PEs')\",\n      \"obligation_statement\": \"The specific duty statement (e.g., 'Report safety risks to authorities')\",\n      \"derived_from\": \"Source principle or law (e.g., 'NSPE Code', 'State Law')\",\n      \"enforcement_context\": \"How enforced in this case\",\n      \"temporal_scope\": \"When this obligation applies\",\n      \"compliance_status\": \"met|unmet|unclear|pending\",\n      \"case_context\": \"How this obligation manifests in the specific case\",\n      \"source_text\": \"EXACT text snippet from case where this obligation is mentioned (max 200 characters)\",\n      \"is_existing_class\": true/false,\n      \"confidence\": 0.0-1.0\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nFocus on:\n1.
