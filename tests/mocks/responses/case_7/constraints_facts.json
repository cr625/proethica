  "prompt": "You are an expert in professional ethics analyzing a case for constraints (boundaries, limitations, and restrictions).\n\nBased on the literature:\n- Constraints are INVIOLABLE BOUNDARIES that limit acceptable actions (Dennis et al. 2016)\n- They differ from obligations by being restrictions rather than requirements\n- Constraints can be legal, physical, resource-based, or procedural\n- They define the space within which ethical decisions must be made\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Identify NEW CONSTRAINT CLASSES not in the existing ontology\n2. Extract SPECIFIC CONSTRAINT INDIVIDUALS from the case\n\n\nEXISTING CONSTRAINTS IN ONTOLOGY (check if your identified constraints match these before creating new classes):\n- Attribution Constraint: Requirements and limitations regarding the disclosure and citation of tools, methods, or sources used in professional work products\n- Competence Constraint: Boundaries defined by agent capabilities and technical limitations (Hallamaa & Kalliokoski 2022)\n- Confidentiality Constraint: Boundaries on information disclosure and privacy (Dennis et al. 2016)\n- Constraint: An information content entity expressing limitations or restrictions on professional actions or decisions. This is the Cs component of the formal specification D=(R,P,O,S,Rs,A,E,Ca,Cs).\n- Defeasible Constraint: Constraints that admit justified exceptions under specified conditions (Ganascia 2007)\n- Ethical Constraint: Professional ethical boundaries beyond legal requirements (Benzmüller et al. 2020)\n- Inviolable Constraint: Absolute constraints that cannot be overridden under any circumstances (Dennis et al. 2016)\n- Jurisdictional Constraint: Boundaries of authority and geographical or organizational scope (Dennis et al. 2016)\n- Legal Constraint: Constraints arising from legal requirements and statutes that establish inviolable boundaries (Kroll 2020, Stenseke 2024)\n- Priority Constraint: Constraints establishing precedence when multiple requirements conflict (Scheutz & Malle 2014)\n- Procedural Constraint: Requirements for following specific processes or protocols (Furbach et al. 2014)\n- Regulatory Constraint: Constraints from regulatory bodies and professional standards organizations (Taddeo et al. 2024)\n- Resource Constraint: Limitations on available time, budget, materials, or human resources (Ganascia 2007)\n- Safety Constraint: Constraints ensuring safety requirements are met (Arkin 2008)\n- Technology Substitution Constraint: Boundaries preventing technology from replacing professional judgment and human oversight in critical decision-making\n\n\nAnalyze this facts section:\n\nEngineer A, an environmental engineer with several years of experience and holding a professional engineering license, was retained by Client W to prepare a comprehensive report addressing the manufacture, use, and characteristics of an organic compound identified as an emerging contaminant of concern. This work required Engineer A to perform an analysis of groundwater monitoring data from a site Engineer A had been observing for over a year. In addition, Engineer A was tasked to develop engineering design documents (plans and specifications) for modifications to groundwater infrastructure at the same site.\nEngineer A is known for their strong technical expertise but is, personally, less confident in their technical writing. Previously, Engineer A had relied on guidance and quality assurance reviews by their mentor and supervisor, Engineer B, to refine report drafts. But Engineer B recently retired and was no longer available to Engineer A in a work capacity.\nFaced with the need to deliver both the report and the engineering design documents without the review by and mentorship from Engineer B, Engineer A opted to use open-sourced artificial intelligence (AI) software to create an initial draft of the necessary report and to use AI-assisted drafting tools to generate preliminary design documents. The AI drafting software was new to the market and Engineer A had no previous experience with the tool. The AI drafting software was also open-sourced.\nFor the report, Engineer A gathered the relevant information provided by Client W and relied on the AI software to synthesize the information and generate an initial draft of the necessary report. Engineer A input the information gathered from Client W into the AI software, and, after a few refining prompts, received a first draft of the report generated by the AI software.\nNot being familiar with the full functionality of the AI software, including the accuracy and originality of AI-generated text, Engineer A conducted a thorough review of the report, cross-checking key facts against professional journal articles and verifying the phrasing by running search engine queries to ensure the content did not match any existing language. Engineer A also made minor adjustments to some of the wording to personalize the content. Engineer A did not cite their use of AI-software or its large language models, and submitted the draft report to Client W for review, including language to clearly identify that the supplied report was a draft, but applied their seal consistent with state law.\nFor the engineering design documents, Engineer A entered the information gathered from Client W into the AI software and relied on the AI-assisted drafting tools to generate a preliminary design of the plans, including basic layouts and technical specifications. Engineer A completed a cursory review of the AI-generated plans and adjusted certain elements to align with site-specific conditions. Again, Engineer A did not cite the AI-assisted drafting tools they used to generate the engineering design documents.\nWhen Client W reviewed the draft report, Client W noted that the section analyzing the groundwater monitoring data would benefit from minor edits for grammar and clarity, but found the introduction discussing the contaminant’s manufacture, use, and characteristics to be exceptionally polished. The Client commented that the report read as if written by two different authors but was otherwise satisfactory. Client W, however, noticed several issues with the AI-generated design documents, including misaligned dimensions and an omission of key safety features required by local regulations. Client W raised concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the engineering design and instructed Engineer A to revise the plans, ensuring that all elements satisfied the necessary professional and regulatory standards.\n\nExtract constraints following this JSON structure:\n\n{\n  \"new_constraint_classes\": [\n    {\n      \"label\": \"Clear, specific constraint class name\",\n      \"definition\": \"What this type of constraint limits or restricts\",\n      \"constraint_type\": \"legal|physical|resource|temporal|procedural\",\n      \"flexibility\": \"hard|soft|negotiable\",\n      \"violation_impact\": \"What happens if this constraint is violated\",\n      \"mitigation_possible\": \"Whether and how this constraint can be mitigated\",\n      \"examples_from_case\": [\"Example 1 from the case\", \"Example 2\"],\n      \"source_text\": \"EXACT text snippet from case where this constraint is identified (max 200 characters)\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.0-1.0,\n      \"reasoning\": \"Why this is a new class not in existing ontology\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"constraint_individuals\": [\n    {\n      \"identifier\": \"Unique name for this specific constraint instance\",\n      \"constraint_class\": \"Name of the constraint class (new or existing)\",\n      \"constrained_entity\": \"What or who is constrained (e.g., 'Engineer L', 'Project')\",\n      \"constraint_statement\": \"The specific limitation (e.g., 'Cannot exceed budget of $X')\",\n      \"source\": \"Origin of constraint (e.g., 'Client budget', 'Environmental law')\",\n      \"enforcement_mechanism\": \"How this constraint is enforced\",\n      \"temporal_scope\": \"When this constraint applies\",\n      \"severity\": \"critical|major|minor\",\n      \"case_context\": \"How this constraint manifests in the specific case\",\n      \"source_text\": \"EXACT text snippet from case where this constraint is mentioned (max 200 characters)\",\n      \"is_existing_class\": true/false,\n      \"confidence\": 0.0-1.0\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nFocus on:\n1.
