STATE INDIVIDUALS (specific instances in this case):\n   - Specific states active in this case narrative\n   - MUST be attached to specific individuals or organizations in the case\n   - Include temporal properties (when initiated, when terminated)\n   - Include causal relationships (triggered by what event, affects which obligations)\n   - Map to existing classes where possible, or to new classes you discover\n\nEXTRACTION GUIDELINES:\n\nFor NEW STATE CLASSES, identify:\n- Label: Clear, professional name for the state type\n- Definition: What this state represents\n- Activation conditions: What events/conditions trigger this state\n- Termination conditions: What events/conditions end this state\n- Persistence type: \"inertial\" (persists until terminated) or \"non-inertial\" (momentary)\n- Affected obligations: Which professional duties does this state affect?\n- Temporal properties: How does this state evolve over time?\n- Domain context: Medical/Engineering/Legal/etc.\n- Examples from case: Specific instances showing this state type\n\nFor STATE INDIVIDUALS, identify:\n- Identifier: Unique descriptor (e.g., \"John_Smith_ConflictOfInterest_ProjectX\")\n- State class: Which state type it represents (existing or new)\n- Subject: WHO is in this state (person/organization name from the case)\n- Initiated by: What event triggered this state?\n- Initiated at: When did this state begin?\n- Terminated by: What event ended this state (if applicable)?\n- Terminated at: When did this state end (if applicable)?\n- Affects obligations: Which specific obligations were affected?\n- Urgency/Intensity: Does this state's urgency change over time?\n- Related parties: Who else is affected by this state?\n- Case involvement: How this state affected the case outcome\n\nCASE TEXT FROM facts SECTION:\nEngineer A, an environmental engineer with several years of experience and holding a professional engineering license, was retained by Client W to prepare a comprehensive report addressing the manufacture, use, and characteristics of an organic compound identified as an emerging contaminant of concern. This work required Engineer A to perform an analysis of groundwater monitoring data from a site Engineer A had been observing for over a year. In addition, Engineer A was tasked to develop engineering design documents (plans and specifications) for modifications to groundwater infrastructure at the same site.\nEngineer A is known for their strong technical expertise but is, personally, less confident in their technical writing. Previously, Engineer A had relied on guidance and quality assurance reviews by their mentor and supervisor, Engineer B, to refine report drafts. But Engineer B recently retired and was no longer available to Engineer A in a work capacity.\nFaced with the need to deliver both the report and the engineering design documents without the review by and mentorship from Engineer B, Engineer A opted to use open-sourced artificial intelligence (AI) software to create an initial draft of the necessary report and to use AI-assisted drafting tools to generate preliminary design documents. The AI drafting software was new to the market and Engineer A had no previous experience with the tool. The AI drafting software was also open-sourced.\nFor the report, Engineer A gathered the relevant information provided by Client W and relied on the AI software to synthesize the information and generate an initial draft of the necessary report. Engineer A input the information gathered from Client W into the AI software, and, after a few refining prompts, received a first draft of the report generated by the AI software.\nNot being familiar with the full functionality of the AI software, including the accuracy and originality of AI-generated text, Engineer A conducted a thorough review of the report, cross-checking key facts against professional journal articles and verifying the phrasing by running search engine queries to ensure the content did not match any existing language. Engineer A also made minor adjustments to some of the wording to personalize the content. Engineer A did not cite their use of AI-software or its large language models, and submitted the draft report to Client W for review, including language to clearly identify that the supplied report was a draft, but applied their seal consistent with state law.\nFor the engineering design documents, Engineer A entered the information gathered from Client W into the AI software and relied on the AI-assisted drafting tools to generate a preliminary design of the plans, including basic layouts and technical specifications. Engineer A completed a cursory review of the AI-generated plans and adjusted certain elements to align with site-specific conditions. Again, Engineer A did not cite the AI-assisted drafting tools they used to generate the engineering design documents.\nWhen Client W reviewed the draft report, Client W noted that the section analyzing the groundwater monitoring data would benefit from minor edits for grammar and clarity, but found the introduction discussing the contaminant’s manufacture, use, and characteristics to be exceptionally polished. The Client commented that the report read as if written by two different authors but was otherwise satisfactory. Client W, however, noticed several issues with the AI-generated design documents, including misaligned dimensions and an omission of key safety features required by local regulations. Client W raised concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the engineering design and instructed Engineer A to revise the plans, ensuring that all elements satisfied the necessary professional and regulatory standards.\n\nRespond with a JSON structure. Here's a CONCRETE EXAMPLE showing the required linkage:\n\nEXAMPLE (if the case mentions \"Engineer A faced a conflict when discovering his brother worked for the contractor\"):\n{\n  \"new_state_classes\": [\n    {\n      \"label\": \"Family Conflict of Interest\",\n      \"definition\": \"A state where a professional's family relationships create potential bias in professional decisions\",\n      \"activation_conditions\": [\"Discovery of family member involvement\", \"Family member has financial interest\"],\n      \"termination_conditions\": [\"Recusal from decision\", \"Family member withdraws\"],\n      \"persistence_type\": \"inertial\",\n      \"affected_obligations\": [\"Duty of impartiality\", \"Disclosure requirements\"],\n      \"temporal_properties\": \"Persists until formally addressed through recusal or disclosure\",\n      \"domain_context\": \"Engineering\",\n      \"examples_from_case\": [\"Engineer A discovered brother worked for ABC Contractors\"],\n      \"source_text\": \"Engineer A faced a conflict when discovering his brother worked for the contractor\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.85,\n      \"rationale\": \"Specific type of conflict not covered by general COI in existing ontology\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"state_individuals\": [\n    {\n      \"identifier\": \"EngineerA_FamilyConflict_ABCContractors\",\n      \"state_class\": \"Family Conflict of Interest\",\n      \"subject\": \"Engineer A\",\n      \"initiated_by\": \"Discovery that brother is senior manager at ABC Contractors\",\n      \"initiated_at\": \"When bidding process began\",\n      \"terminated_by\": \"Engineer A recused from contractor selection\",\n      \"terminated_at\": \"Two weeks after discovery\",\n      \"affects_obligations\": [\"Maintain impartial contractor selection\", \"Disclose conflicts to client\"],\n      \"urgency_level\": \"high\",\n      \"related_parties\": [\"Client B\", \"ABC Contractors\", \"Engineer A's brother\"],\n      \"case_involvement\": \"Led to Engineer A's recusal from contractor selection process\",\n      \"source_text\": \"Engineer A discovered his brother is senior manager at ABC Contractors during the bidding process\",\n      \"is_existing_class\": false,\n      \"confidence\": 0.9\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nYOUR RESPONSE FORMAT (use the same structure with YOUR case's specific details):\n{\n  \"new_state_classes\": [\n    // For each new state type you discover\n  ],\n  \"state_individuals\": [\n    // For each specific instance in the case (MUST have at least one per new class)\n  ]\n}\n\nEXTRACTION RULES:\n1. For EVERY new state class you identify, you MUST provide at least one corresponding state individual\n2. State individuals MUST have a clear subject (specific person/organization from the case)\n3. If you cannot identify a specific instance, do not create the state class\n4. States without subjects are invalid (e.g., cannot have \"general emergency\" - must be \"City M's water emergency\")\n5. Each state individual should clearly demonstrate why its state class is needed\n\nFocus on states that:\n1. Are attached to specific individuals or organizations mentioned in the case\n2. Have clear temporal boundaries (when initiated, when terminated)\n3. Affect specific ethical obligations or professional duties\n4. Show causal relationships with events in the case\n5. Demonstrate the context-dependent nature of professional ethics\n\nEXAMPLE OF CORRECT EXTRACTION:\nState Class: \"Public Health Risk State\"\nState Individual: \"City_M_PublicHealthRisk_2023\" with subject=\"City M\", initiated_by=\"Decision to change water source\", affects_obligations=[\"Ensure public safety\", \"Provide clean water\"]\n\nEXAMPLE OF INCORRECT EXTRACTION:\nState Class: \"Emergency Situation\" with NO corresponding individual (INVALID - no specific instance)\n",
