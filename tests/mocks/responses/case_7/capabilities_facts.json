  "prompt": "You are an expert in professional ethics analyzing a case for capabilities (competencies and skills required for professional practice).\n\nBased on the literature:\n- Capabilities are COMPETENCIES that enable norm compliance (Hallamaa & Kalliokoski 2022)\n- They represent the skills needed to fulfill professional obligations (Dennis et al. 2016)\n- Capabilities include technical, ethical, communicative, and analytical competencies\n- They constitute \"norm competence\" - the ability to act ethically (Kong et al. 2020)\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Identify NEW CAPABILITY CLASSES not in the existing ontology\n2. Extract SPECIFIC CAPABILITY INDIVIDUALS from the case\n\n\nEXISTING CAPABILITIES IN ONTOLOGY (check if your identified capabilities match these before creating new classes):\n- AI Tool Evaluation Capability: The competency to assess, validate, and appropriately use AI-generated content in professional work\n- Capability: A realizable entity that can be realized by specific types of actions or processes in professional contexts. This is the Ca component of the formal specification D=(R,P,O,S,Rs,A,E,Ca,Cs).\n- Capability Type: Meta-class for specific capability types recognized by the ProEthica system\n- Data Privacy Protection Capability: The competency to safeguard confidential client information when using digital tools and platforms\n- Justification Capability: Capability to trace reasoning paths connecting decisions to authoritative sources (McLaren 2003, Anderson & Anderson 2018)\n- Regulatory Compliance Capability: The competency to ensure designs and documents meet local regulations and safety standards\n- Responsible Charge Capability: The competency to maintain active engagement and supervisory control from conception to completion of engineering work\n- Technical Capability: A specialized technical skill or competency in a professional domain\n- Technical Writing Capability: The competency to produce clear, accurate, and professional technical documentation and reports\n- Technology Integration Capability: The competency to appropriately integrate new technologies while maintaining professional judgment\n\n\nAnalyze this facts section:\n\nEngineer A, an environmental engineer with several years of experience and holding a professional engineering license, was retained by Client W to prepare a comprehensive report addressing the manufacture, use, and characteristics of an organic compound identified as an emerging contaminant of concern. This work required Engineer A to perform an analysis of groundwater monitoring data from a site Engineer A had been observing for over a year. In addition, Engineer A was tasked to develop engineering design documents (plans and specifications) for modifications to groundwater infrastructure at the same site.\nEngineer A is known for their strong technical expertise but is, personally, less confident in their technical writing. Previously, Engineer A had relied on guidance and quality assurance reviews by their mentor and supervisor, Engineer B, to refine report drafts. But Engineer B recently retired and was no longer available to Engineer A in a work capacity.\nFaced with the need to deliver both the report and the engineering design documents without the review by and mentorship from Engineer B, Engineer A opted to use open-sourced artificial intelligence (AI) software to create an initial draft of the necessary report and to use AI-assisted drafting tools to generate preliminary design documents. The AI drafting software was new to the market and Engineer A had no previous experience with the tool. The AI drafting software was also open-sourced.\nFor the report, Engineer A gathered the relevant information provided by Client W and relied on the AI software to synthesize the information and generate an initial draft of the necessary report. Engineer A input the information gathered from Client W into the AI software, and, after a few refining prompts, received a first draft of the report generated by the AI software.\nNot being familiar with the full functionality of the AI software, including the accuracy and originality of AI-generated text, Engineer A conducted a thorough review of the report, cross-checking key facts against professional journal articles and verifying the phrasing by running search engine queries to ensure the content did not match any existing language. Engineer A also made minor adjustments to some of the wording to personalize the content. Engineer A did not cite their use of AI-software or its large language models, and submitted the draft report to Client W for review, including language to clearly identify that the supplied report was a draft, but applied their seal consistent with state law.\nFor the engineering design documents, Engineer A entered the information gathered from Client W into the AI software and relied on the AI-assisted drafting tools to generate a preliminary design of the plans, including basic layouts and technical specifications. Engineer A completed a cursory review of the AI-generated plans and adjusted certain elements to align with site-specific conditions. Again, Engineer A did not cite the AI-assisted drafting tools they used to generate the engineering design documents.\nWhen Client W reviewed the draft report, Client W noted that the section analyzing the groundwater monitoring data would benefit from minor edits for grammar and clarity, but found the introduction discussing the contaminant’s manufacture, use, and characteristics to be exceptionally polished. The Client commented that the report read as if written by two different authors but was otherwise satisfactory. Client W, however, noticed several issues with the AI-generated design documents, including misaligned dimensions and an omission of key safety features required by local regulations. Client W raised concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the engineering design and instructed Engineer A to revise the plans, ensuring that all elements satisfied the necessary professional and regulatory standards.\n\nExtract capabilities following this JSON structure:\n\n{\n  \"new_capability_classes\": [\n    {\n      \"label\": \"Clear, specific capability class name\",\n      \"definition\": \"What competency or skill this capability represents\",\n      \"capability_type\": \"technical|ethical|communicative|analytical\",\n      \"norm_competence_related\": \"Which professional obligations this capability enables\",\n      \"skill_level\": \"basic|intermediate|advanced|expert\",\n      \"acquisition_method\": \"How this capability is typically acquired (education, training, experience)\",\n      \"examples_from_case\": [\"Example 1 from the case\", \"Example 2\"],\n      \"source_text\": \"EXACT text snippet from case where this capability is identified (max 200 characters)\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.0-1.0,\n      \"reasoning\": \"Why this is a new class not in existing ontology\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"capability_individuals\": [\n    {\n      \"identifier\": \"Unique name for this specific capability instance\",\n      \"capability_class\": \"Name of the capability class (new or existing)\",\n      \"possessed_by\": \"Who has this capability (e.g., 'Engineer L', 'All Licensed PEs')\",\n      \"capability_statement\": \"The specific competency (e.g., 'Design stormwater systems')\",\n      \"demonstrated_through\": \"How shown in the case (e.g., 'Years of experience', 'Professional license')\",\n      \"proficiency_level\": \"basic|intermediate|advanced|expert\",\n      \"enables_obligations\": \"Which obligations this capability enables\",\n      \"temporal_aspect\": \"When this capability is relevant\",\n      \"case_context\": \"How this capability manifests in the specific case\",\n      \"source_text\": \"EXACT text snippet from case where this capability is mentioned (max 200 characters)\",\n      \"is_existing_class\": true/false,\n      \"confidence\": 0.0-1.0\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nFocus on:\n1.
