  "prompt": "You are an expert in professional ethics analyzing a case for obligations (professional duties and requirements).\n\nBased on the literature:\n- Obligations are CONCRETE PROFESSIONAL DUTIES derived from abstract principles (Hallamaa & Kalliokoski 2022)\n- They specify what professionals MUST, SHOULD, or MUST NOT do (Dennis et al. 2016)\n- Obligations have deontic force and are enforceable (Wooldridge & Jennings 1995)\n- They operationalize principles in specific contexts (Kong et al. 2020)\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Identify NEW OBLIGATION CLASSES not in the existing ontology\n2. Extract SPECIFIC OBLIGATION INDIVIDUALS from the case\n\n\nEXISTING OBLIGATIONS IN ONTOLOGY (check if your identified obligations match these before creating new classes):\n- Attribution Obligation: Duty to properly cite and acknowledge all sources, tools, and methods used in creating professional deliverables\n- Collegial Obligation: Duties toward professional peers including respect, fairness, and credit for work\n- Competence Obligation: Requirement to perform services only in areas of competence (NSPE II.2)\n- Conditional Obligation: Obligations that apply only when specific conditions are met\n- Confidentiality Obligation: Duty to protect confidential information of clients or employers (NSPE III.4)\n- Defeasible Obligation: Obligations that admit justified exceptions under specified conditions (Ganascia 2007)\n- Disclosure Obligation: Requirement to inform stakeholders about conflicts, limitations, or risks (NSPE II.3.a)\n- Ethical Obligation: Obligations arising from ethical principles beyond legal requirements\n- Legal Obligation: Obligations arising from legal requirements and regulations\n- Mandatory Obligation: Obligations that MUST be fulfilled (deontic force: mandatory)\n- Obligation: An information content entity expressing required actions or behaviors in professional contexts. This is the O component of the formal specification D=(R,P,O,S,Rs,A,E,Ca,Cs).\n- Prima Facie Obligation: Obligations that hold at first appearance but may be overridden by stronger duties (Anderson & Anderson)\n- Professional Obligation: A duty or responsibility arising from professional role or standards\n- Quality Assurance Obligation: Requirement to implement appropriate review and verification processes for all professional deliverables before submission\n- Reporting Obligation: Duty to report violations or unsafe conditions to appropriate authorities\n- Responsible Charge Obligation: Duty to maintain active engagement and personal decision-making authority throughout engineering process from conception to completion\n- Safety Obligation: Duty to hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public (NSPE I.1)\n- Technology Competence Obligation: Requirement to understand and verify the capabilities, limitations, and risks of technological tools used in professional practice\n- Technology Verification Obligation: Requirement to thoroughly verify and validate outputs from technological tools including AI before incorporating them into professional work\n\n\nAnalyze this facts section:\n\nEngineer A, an environmental engineer with several years of experience and holding a professional engineering license, was retained by Client W to prepare a comprehensive report addressing the manufacture, use, and characteristics of an organic compound identified as an emerging contaminant of concern. This work required Engineer A to perform an analysis of groundwater monitoring data from a site Engineer A had been observing for over a year. In addition, Engineer A was tasked to develop engineering design documents (plans and specifications) for modifications to groundwater infrastructure at the same site.\nEngineer A is known for their strong technical expertise but is, personally, less confident in their technical writing. Previously, Engineer A had relied on guidance and quality assurance reviews by their mentor and supervisor, Engineer B, to refine report drafts. But Engineer B recently retired and was no longer available to Engineer A in a work capacity.\nFaced with the need to deliver both the report and the engineering design documents without the review by and mentorship from Engineer B, Engineer A opted to use open-sourced artificial intelligence (AI) software to create an initial draft of the necessary report and to use AI-assisted drafting tools to generate preliminary design documents. The AI drafting software was new to the market and Engineer A had no previous experience with the tool. The AI drafting software was also open-sourced.\nFor the report, Engineer A gathered the relevant information provided by Client W and relied on the AI software to synthesize the information and generate an initial draft of the necessary report. Engineer A input the information gathered from Client W into the AI software, and, after a few refining prompts, received a first draft of the report generated by the AI software.\nNot being familiar with the full functionality of the AI software, including the accuracy and originality of AI-generated text, Engineer A conducted a thorough review of the report, cross-checking key facts against professional journal articles and verifying the phrasing by running search engine queries to ensure the content did not match any existing language. Engineer A also made minor adjustments to some of the wording to personalize the content. Engineer A did not cite their use of AI-software or its large language models, and submitted the draft report to Client W for review, including language to clearly identify that the supplied report was a draft, but applied their seal consistent with state law.\nFor the engineering design documents, Engineer A entered the information gathered from Client W into the AI software and relied on the AI-assisted drafting tools to generate a preliminary design of the plans, including basic layouts and technical specifications. Engineer A completed a cursory review of the AI-generated plans and adjusted certain elements to align with site-specific conditions. Again, Engineer A did not cite the AI-assisted drafting tools they used to generate the engineering design documents.\nWhen Client W reviewed the draft report, Client W noted that the section analyzing the groundwater monitoring data would benefit from minor edits for grammar and clarity, but found the introduction discussing the contaminant’s manufacture, use, and characteristics to be exceptionally polished. The Client commented that the report read as if written by two different authors but was otherwise satisfactory. Client W, however, noticed several issues with the AI-generated design documents, including misaligned dimensions and an omission of key safety features required by local regulations. Client W raised concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the engineering design and instructed Engineer A to revise the plans, ensuring that all elements satisfied the necessary professional and regulatory standards.\n\nExtract obligations following this JSON structure:\n\n{\n  \"new_obligation_classes\": [\n    {\n      \"label\": \"Clear, specific obligation class name\",\n      \"definition\": \"What this type of obligation requires professionals to do\",\n      \"derived_from_principle\": \"Which principle this operationalizes (e.g., 'Public Safety', 'Honesty')\",\n      \"duty_type\": \"professional|legal|ethical|societal\",\n      \"enforcement_mechanism\": \"How this obligation is typically enforced\",\n      \"violation_consequences\": \"What happens when this obligation is violated\",\n      \"examples_from_case\": [\"Example 1 from the case\", \"Example 2\"],\n      \"source_text\": \"EXACT text snippet from case where this obligation is identified (max 200 characters)\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.0-1.0,\n      \"reasoning\": \"Why this is a new class not in existing ontology\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"obligation_individuals\": [\n    {\n      \"identifier\": \"Unique name for this specific obligation instance\",\n      \"obligation_class\": \"Name of the obligation class (new or existing)\",\n      \"obligated_party\": \"Who has this obligation (e.g., 'Engineer L', 'All Licensed PEs')\",\n      \"obligation_statement\": \"The specific duty statement (e.g., 'Report safety risks to authorities')\",\n      \"derived_from\": \"Source principle or law (e.g., 'NSPE Code', 'State Law')\",\n      \"enforcement_context\": \"How enforced in this case\",\n      \"temporal_scope\": \"When this obligation applies\",\n      \"compliance_status\": \"met|unmet|unclear|pending\",\n      \"case_context\": \"How this obligation manifests in the specific case\",\n      \"source_text\": \"EXACT text snippet from case where this obligation is mentioned (max 200 characters)\",\n      \"is_existing_class\": true/false,\n      \"confidence\": 0.0-1.0\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nFocus on:\n1.
