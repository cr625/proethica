# Debug Breakpoints Issue and Solution

Based on the log output you've shared, I've analyzed the issue with breakpoints not being triggered during the guideline concept extraction flow. Here's what's happening and how to fix it:

## Current Behavior

1. The MCP server starts successfully and logs initialization messages
2. When the "Analyze Concepts" button is clicked, requests are sent to the MCP server
3. The server is processing these requests (as seen in the logs), but the debugger breakpoints aren't being triggered
4. You're seeing log entries like `aiohttp.access - INFO - ::1 [15/May/2025:14:37:48 +0000] "POST /jsonrpc HTTP/1.1"` which shows requests arriving

## Why Breakpoints Aren't Triggering

There are several possible reasons:

1. **Event Loop Issues**: The aiohttp server runs in an asyncio event loop, which can sometimes interfere with the debugger's ability to pause execution at breakpoints

2. **Breakpoints Being Passed During Server Start**: As you mentioned, you hit breakpoints during server startup and continued past them. The VSCode debugger may be getting confused by this.

3. **Debug Mode Not Active During Request Processing**: While the server is running in debug mode (as indicated by log messages), the debug hooks might not be active during request handling.

## Solution: Adding More Debug Logging

Since you're already able to see detailed logs, let's enhance them to trace execution more clearly:

1. The console already shows your call is reaching the extract_guideline_concepts method, as seen here:
```
2025-05-15 14:37:48,358 - mcp.modules.guideline_analysis_module - DEBUG - BREAKPOINT: Hit extract_guideline_concepts at /workspaces/ai-ethical-dm/mcp/modules/guideline_analysis_module.py:236
```

2. The module is adding custom debug logging that shows what's happening even without breakpoints. Let's add more of these across the request handling flow.

## Debugging Approach

Since breakpoints aren't working as expected, let's use an alternative approach:

1. **Enhanced Logging**: Add more detailed logging at key points in the code flow
2. **Continue with Debug Mode**: Keep running the server in debug mode
3. **Use JSON-RPC Request Tracing**: Enhance the `handle_jsonrpc` method with more logging
4. **Extract Debug Statements**: Log key variable values at critical points

## Steps to Implement

1. Add more debug logging in server-side code
2. Watch the console output during execution
3. If needed, add a logger.debug statement with `import inspect; current_frame = inspect.currentframe(); frame_info = inspect.getframeinfo(current_frame); logger.debug(f"BREAKPOINT: Hit at {frame_info.filename}:{frame_info.lineno}")`
4. Add object inspection with detailed dumps of key objects

## VSCode Debug Launch Settings

To improve the debug experience, make sure your launch.json for debugging the server has:

```json
{
    "name": "Debug Enhanced MCP Server with Guidelines",
    "type": "python",
    "request": "launch",
    "program": "${workspaceFolder}/mcp/run_enhanced_mcp_server_with_guidelines.py",
    "console": "integratedTerminal",
    "justMyCode": false,
    "env": {
        "MCP_DEBUG": "true",
        "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1"
    }
}
```

Setting `"justMyCode": false` can help with stepping into library code if needed.

## Note on Breakpoint Storage

Check if your breakpoints are being stored properly in the `.vscode/breakpoints.json` file. Sometimes VSCode doesn't correctly sync breakpoints across sessions.
