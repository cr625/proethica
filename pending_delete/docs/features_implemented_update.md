# Recent Updates and Features Implemented

## Guideline Section Integration Optimization (May 21, 2025)

### Problem
The guideline section integration process was taking an excessively long time to complete because it was attempting to process all guideline triples in the database, including many that were not relevant to the current application functionality.

### Solution
We implemented a selective cleanup approach that preserves only the guideline triples needed for the core functionality:

1. **Database Analysis**:
   - Identified 127 guideline concept triples in the `entity_triples` table with IDs between 3096 and 3222
   - Confirmed these triples were associated with guideline ID 43, linked to document ID 190 ("Engineering Ethics")
   - Determined the relationship between document 190 and guideline 43 through the `guideline_metadata` column

2. **Cleanup Process Development**:
   - Created `cleanup_selective_guideline_triples_v2.sql` to selectively preserve needed triples
   - Developed `run_cleanup_selective_guideline_triples_v2.py` for safe execution with confirmation
   - Documented the process in `guideline_section_integration_enhancement.md`

3. **Performance Improvements**:
   - Reduced the number of guideline triples being processed in the embedding comparison step
   - Maintained all necessary triples for proper application functionality
   - Significantly improved batch processing speed (from slow/hanging process to 100-170 iterations per second)

### Technical Implementation
- SQL transaction ensures atomicity of cleanup operations
- Python wrapper provides user interface with confirmation prompt
- Logging implemented for audit purposes
- Full verification steps included to confirm proper cleanup

### Future Considerations
1. Implement more selective approach to triple generation and storage for future guideline imports
2. Add database indexes on frequently queried columns (`entity_type` and `world_id`)
3. Consider periodic pruning of unused guidelines as part of database maintenance
