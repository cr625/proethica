# Section Embedding Duplication Fix - Summary

## Issue Addressed
Fixed a unique constraint violation issue when processing section embeddings from different document sources that have the same section IDs (e.g., 'facts', 'discussion') by implementing section deduplication logic.

## Implementation Details
- Created a fix script that safely updates the section_embedding_service.py file
- Added deduplication logic to both the section metadata extraction and embedding storage processes
- Implemented URI normalization to ensure consistent section identifiers
- Added detection and appropriate handling of duplicate section IDs from different URI sources
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing documents

## Testing
- Successfully tested with a new case (ID: 237)
- Confirmed document structure generation works without unique constraint errors
- Verified section embeddings are generated and stored properly

## Future Considerations
- Continue monitoring for any potential issues with section URI mapping
- Consider adding a database index on (document_id, section_id) if needed for performance
- Update documentation for future developers to be aware of the deduplication strategy
