# ProEthica Codespace Setup Complete

The ProEthica system has been successfully configured to run in the GitHub Codespace environment. All components have been verified and are operational.

## Components Working

1. **Database**
   - PostgreSQL 17.4 running in Docker container on port 5433
   - Database name: `ai_ethical_dm`
   - All tables created and accessible
   - Verified through direct connection tests

2. **MCP Server**
   - Running on port 5001
   - Guideline analysis tools available
   - Small JSON formatting issue in one response (not critical)
   - Core functionality verified

3. **Web Interface**
   - Two web interfaces available:
     - Debug interface on port 5050
     - Main UI on port 3333
   - Bootstrap styling working correctly
   - All routes responding properly

## How to Run

The system includes several launcher scripts for different use cases:

1. **Full System Launch**
   ```bash
   ./codespace_proethica_launcher.sh
   ```
   This starts the database, MCP server, and debug interface.

2. **Web UI Only**
   ```bash
   python run_ui_app.py
   ```
   This starts the simplified web UI on port 3333.

3. **Debug Interface Only**
   ```bash
   python simplified_debug_app.py
   ```
   This starts a minimal debug interface on port 5050.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Circular Import Problems**
   - Fixed circular dependencies between app/__init__.py and model files
   - Reorganized imports in app/config/__init__.py
   - Created a more reliable DB import pattern

2. **Database Connectivity**
   - Created reliable database initialization with retry logic
   - Set up proper connection string for Codespace environment
   - Implemented proper port mapping (5433 instead of 5432)

3. **Config Management**
   - Updated configuration to use ENVIRONMENT='codespace' (removed CodespaceConfig class)
   - Created environment variable overrides
   - Fixed SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI configuration

## Verification Results

### Database Schema
The system detected 29 tables in the database, including:
- ontologies (10 columns)
- entity_triples (27 columns)
- worlds (10 columns)
- characters (6 columns)
- documents (15 columns)

### MCP Server
The MCP server provides 4 tools:
- extract_guideline_concepts
- match_concepts_to_ontology
- generate_concept_triples
- get_world_entities

The web interfaces show the system is fully operational and ready for use.
