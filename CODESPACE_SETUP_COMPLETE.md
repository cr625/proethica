# Codespace Setup Complete

The ProEthica application has been updated to run properly in GitHub Codespaces environment.

## Key Changes Made

1. **Circular Import Fixes**
   - Fixed circular imports between app modules and models
   - Updated all model files to import db from app.models instead of app directly
   - Modified MCP server code to avoid circular imports

2. **Codespace Configuration**
   - Created a dedicated Codespace configuration class
   - Added proper database connection settings for Codespace (port 5433)
   - Set environment-specific variables

3. **Custom Launcher Script**
   - Created `codespace_custom_start.sh` for Codespace-specific startup
   - Implemented proper process management for the MCP server
   - Set appropriate environment variables for the Codespace environment

4. **Special Entry Point**
   - Created `codespace_run.py` as a specialized entry point for Codespaces
   - Added robust server status checking and error handling
   - Configured proper logging

## How to Run the Application

You now have two ways to start the application:

### Option 1: Using the Custom Codespace Starter (Recommended)

```bash
./codespace_custom_start.sh
```

This script:
1. Sets up PostgreSQL for Codespaces
2. Starts the MCP server with guidelines support
3. Tests the MCP server connectivity
4. Launches the Flask application with proper configuration

### Option 2: Using the Updated Main Starter Script

```bash
./start_proethica_updated.sh
```

This script has been updated to auto-detect the Codespace environment and apply the proper configuration.

## Verification and Testing

After starting the application, you can verify it's working properly:

1. Access the web interface at the URL shown in the terminal
2. Test the MCP server connection using:
   ```bash
   python test_mcp_jsonrpc_connection.py
   ```
3. Verify PostgreSQL connectivity:
   ```bash
   psql -h localhost -p 5433 -U postgres -d ai_ethical_dm
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the MCP server logs:
   ```bash
   tail -f logs/enhanced_ontology_server_codespace.log
   ```

2. Restart the PostgreSQL container if needed:
   ```bash
   docker restart postgres17-pgvector-codespace
   ```

3. Fix circular imports again if code is modified:
   ```bash
   python fix_all_model_imports.py
   ```

## Next Steps

See `mcp_integration_plan.md` for details on the ongoing MCP server UI integration plan, which outlines further improvements to the system architecture and user interface.
