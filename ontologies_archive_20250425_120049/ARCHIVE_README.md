# Ontology TTL File Archive

This directory contains archived copies of the original TTL ontology files that were previously 
stored in the `mcp/ontology` directory. These files have been archived as part of the migration
to database-based ontology storage.

**Archive created on:** 2025-04-25 12:00:49

## Files Included

The following TTL files are included in this archive:

```
proethica-intermediate.ttl
bfo-core.ttl
engineering-ethics-nspe-extended.ttl
```

## Usage

These files are kept for reference purposes only. The active system now uses 
ontologies stored directly in the database. If you need to restore these files,
copy them back to the `mcp/ontology` directory, but note that this may cause
conflicts if the database versions have been modified.
