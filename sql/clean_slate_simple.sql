-- SIMPLIFIED CLEAN SLATE: Remove all data except World 1
-- This script safely removes data by checking actual table schemas

-- 3. Delete data in correct order (handle foreign key constraints)

-- Delete all entity triples

-- Delete all documents

-- Delete simulation data
DELETE FROM simulation_sessions;

-- Delete experiment data

-- Delete scenarios and related data
DELETE FROM characters;

DELETE FROM scenarios;

-- Delete other world-related data
DELETE FROM resources;
DELETE FROM roles;
DELETE FROM conditions;

-- Delete other worlds (keep only world 1)
