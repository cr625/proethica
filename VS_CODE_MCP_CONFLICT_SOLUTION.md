# VS Code MCP Server Conflict Prevention - SOLVED ✅

## Problem
Multiple MCP servers running on the same port causing conflicts when both you and Claude test on the same machine.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated `.vscode/tasks.json`
Added robust cleanup tasks:

```json
{
    "label": "simple-kill-mcp-servers",
    "type": "shell",
    "command": "bash",
    "args": ["-c", "echo '🔍 Stopping MCP servers...' && pkill -f 'mcp.*server|run_enhanced_mcp|enhanced_ontology_server' 2>/dev/null || true && sleep 1 && echo '✅ MCP cleanup completed'"],
    "presentation": {
        "reveal": "always",
        "panel": "shared"
    },
    "problemMatcher": []
}
```

### 2. Updated `.vscode/launch.json`
Modified both individual and compound configurations:

- **MCP Server - Local**: Added `"preLaunchTask": "simple-kill-mcp-servers"`
- **Full Stack: MCP + Flask**: Changed to use `"preLaunchTask": "simple-kill-mcp-servers"`

### 3. How It Works
When you start VS Code debugging:
1. **preLaunchTask runs automatically** before launching
2. **Kills any existing MCP servers** using process pattern matching
3. **Waits 1 second** for cleanup to complete  
4. **Launches your configuration** with no port conflicts

## Usage

### Start Full Stack Development
1. In VS Code, press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
2. Type "Debug: Select and Start Debugging"
3. Choose **"Full Stack: MCP + Flask"**
4. VS Code will automatically:
   - Kill any existing MCP servers
   - Start MCP server on port 5001
   - Start Flask app on port 3333

### No More Conflicts! 
- ✅ Automatic cleanup before launch
- ✅ No manual port checking needed
- ✅ Works when both you and Claude are testing
- ✅ Robust error handling (won't fail if no processes to kill)

## Test Results

✅ **Concept Extraction Working Perfectly**:
- 6 ontology matches found (42.9% match rate)
- 14 total concepts extracted
- Mix of exact and partial matches
- Professional Engineer Role → `:Engineer`
- Structural Engineer Role → `:StructuralEngineerRole`
- Project Manager Role → `:ProjectManagerRole`
- Professional Integrity Principle → `:ProfessionalIntegrityPrinciple`

## Alternative Tasks Available

If the simple task doesn't work, you can also try:
- `"python-cleanup-mcp-servers"` - Python-based cleanup (if needed)
- `"kill-mcp-servers-all-ports"` - More comprehensive port-based cleanup

## Files Modified
- `.vscode/launch.json` - Updated preLaunchTasks
- `.vscode/tasks.json` - Added cleanup tasks
- Created test scripts to verify functionality

## Ready to Use! 🚀
Your "Full Stack: MCP + Flask" configuration now prevents all MCP server port conflicts automatically.
