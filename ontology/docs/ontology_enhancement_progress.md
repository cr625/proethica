# Ontology Enhancement Implementation Progress

This document tracks the progress of the ontology enhancement implementation plan. It details the steps that have been completed and what remains to be done.

## Completed Steps

### 1. Database Migration - ✅ Complete

Created and applied the necessary database schema for the new section-triple association system:

- Created `section_ontology_associations` table with the following structure:
  - `id`: Integer (Primary Key)
  - `section_id`: Integer (Foreign Key to document_sections.id)
  - `concept_uri`: Text (URI of the ontology concept)
  - `concept_label`: Text (Label of the ontology concept)
  - `match_score`: Double (Similarity/match score)
  - `match_type`: Text (Type of match)
  - `created_at`: Timestamp

- Created appropriate indexes:
  - Index on `section_id` for quick lookups by section
  - Index on `concept_uri` for concept filtering
  - Index on `match_score` (descending) for sorting by relevance

### 2. Storage Layer - ✅ Complete

Updated the `SectionTripleAssociationStorage` class to match the database schema and handle:

- Connection to the database
- Creating tables and indexes if needed
- Storing section-concept associations
- Retrieving section-concept associations
- Deleting associations

### 3. Service Layer - ✅ Complete

Updated the `SectionTripleAssociationService` class to:

- Work with the new storage layer
- Map between the associator's output and the storage format
- Ensure compatibility with the updated database schema
- Support backward compatibility with existing code

## In Progress

### 4. Testing with Documents

- Need to test the system with real documents to verify functioning
- Initial tests showed connection to the ontology loader was successful
- Need to debug the issue with section embeddings or concept matching  

### 5. Integration with Document UI

- Need to integrate the new association system with the document UI
- Display concepts associated with document sections
- Allow filtering and exploration of concept associations

## Next Steps

1. Debug the associator to fix the section-concept matching (all sections currently failing)
2. Complete end-to-end testing with a sample document
3. Update the Document UI to show concept associations
4. Implement the concept filtering functionality
5. Document the updated functionality in user guides

## Issues and Challenges

- The initial run of the associator failed for all sections - need to debug why no matches were found
- Possible issues:
  - Ontology loader might not be correctly loading the concepts
  - Section embeddings might not be accessible
  - Similarity threshold might be too high
  - Failure in the association algorithm

## Technical Implementation Details

The implementation follows the design in the implementation plan, with components divided into:

1. `OntologyTripleLoader` - Loads ontology concepts from TTL files
2. `EmbeddingService` - Provides embedding generation for text
3. `SectionTripleAssociator` - Associates sections with concepts based on similarity
4. `SectionTripleAssociationStorage` - Handles database storage operations
5. `SectionTripleAssociationService` - Coordinates the overall process

The system is designed to be used both as a batch process and as an on-demand service for individual sections.
