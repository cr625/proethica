2. If new, identify which category it belongs to

more descriptive (e.g., "Engineer Role" not just "Engineer").

You are analyzing an ethics guideline to extract PROFESSIONAL ROLES based on the ProEthica formalism and professional ethics literature.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK - Key Insights from Professional Ethics Literature:

Roles are not merely job titles but obligation-generating entities that:
- **Ethical Filters**: Transform general moral duties into role-specific obligations (Dennis et al. 2016 empirical study of 127 professional codes)
- **Identity Formation**: Shape professional identity through distinctive goals and practices (Oakley & Cocking 2001 virtue ethics framework)
- **Relationship Structures**: Define professional relationships and their associated duties (Kong et al. 2020 analysis of engineering ethics cases)

**KONG ET AL. (2020) FOUR-CATEGORY FRAMEWORK:**
Based on analysis of 500+ engineering ethics cases, all professional roles fall into these categories:

1. **Provider-Client** → Service delivery relationships (Engineer-Client)
   - Duties: Competent service, confidentiality, client welfare
   
2. **Professional Peer** → Collegial relationships (Senior-Junior, Mentor-Mentee)
   - Duties: Peer review, mentoring, knowledge sharing
   
3. **Employer Relationship** → Organizational relationships (Employee-Employer)
   - Duties: Loyalty, competent performance, honest reporting
   
4. **Public Responsibility** → Societal obligations (Engineer-Public)
   - Duties: Public welfare paramount, can override other interests

**EXTRACTION PROCESS:**
1. Identify all roles mentioned (explicit or implied)
2. Match against existing ontology roles (use is_existing: true/false)
3. Categorize using Kong framework (required for all roles)
4. Identify obligations generated by each role
5. Note role conflicts if present

You are analyzing an ethics guideline to extract PROFESSIONAL RESOURCES as part of Pass 1 (Contextual Framework) of the ProEthica extraction.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK - Key Insights from Extensional Principles Literature:

Resources are not merely documents but professional knowledge sources that ground ethical reasoning:
- **Extensional Grounding**: Abstract principles require concrete cases and precedents for meaning (McLaren 2003 analysis of NSPE case system)
- **Identity Establishment**: Professional codes create identity frameworks beyond rule lists (analysis of 50+ professional codes)
- **Analogical Reasoning**: Case precedents enable pattern-based ethical reasoning (empirical study of 200+ NSPE BER cases)
- **Collective Wisdom**: Technical standards embody professional consensus (review of engineering standard development)

**RELATIONSHIP TO PASS 1 (WHO-WHEN-WHAT):**
Resources complete the contextual triad:
- Roles (WHO) identify obligation bearers
- States (WHEN) activate those obligations
- Resources (WHAT) provide knowledge to fulfill obligations

FOUR CORE RESOURCE TYPES TO IDENTIFY:

1. **Professional Codes (ProfessionalCode)**
   - Definition: Formal codified professional ethics standards (e.g., NSPE Code, IEEE Code)
   - Function: Establish professional identity, create accountability, provide deliberation frameworks
   - Extensional Role: Distillations of collective experience that guide and justify actions
   - Examples: "NSPE Code of Ethics", "ACM Code of Professional Conduct", "IEEE Code of Ethics"

2. **Case Precedents (CasePrecedent)**
   - Definition: Documented cases from ethics review boards providing precedential knowledge
   - Function: Offer analogical reasoning patterns for similar situations
   - Extensional Role: Concrete instances that ground abstract principles in professional reality
   - Examples: "NSPE Board of Ethical Review Case 92-6", "Previous similar incident rulings"

3. **Expert Interpretations (ExpertInterpretation)**
   - Definition: Authoritative explanations bridging principles to specific contexts
   - Function: Provide nuanced understanding of how principles apply in complex situations
   - Extensional Role: Professional consensus on principle application in edge cases
   - Examples: "Ethics committee guidance", "Senior professional consultation", "Expert panel recommendations"

4. **Technical Standards (TechnicalStandard)**
   - Definition: Industry standards and specifications defining acceptable practice
   - Function: Establish minimum professional competence and quality benchmarks
   - Extensional Role: Collective professional agreement on technical acceptability
   - Examples: "ASME Boiler Code", "IEEE Standards", "ISO 9001 Quality Standards", "Building Codes"

ADDITIONAL RESOURCE CATEGORIES:

5. **Legal Resources**: Laws, regulations, statutes governing professional practice
6. **Decision Tools**: Frameworks, methodologies, assessment tools for ethical analysis
7. **Reference Materials**: Handbooks, manuals, guides supporting professional practice

EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:

- Focus on resources that provide extensional grounding for ethical decisions
- Identify how resources function as professional knowledge sources
- Consider resources that establish professional identity and accountability
- Look for resources that bridge abstract principles to concrete practice
- Prioritize resources that embody collective professional wisdom

THEORETICAL FOUNDATION:

Pass 1 identifies the key entities involved in professional ethics situations:
- WHO: Professional and stakeholder roles that bear obligations and make decisions
- WHAT: Resources and tools that guide ethical decision-making

These entities form the foundation for understanding:
1. Who has professional obligations (Roles as obligation bearers)
2. What resources ground ethical decisions (Resources as extensional knowledge)
3. How roles and resources interact in professional practice

EXTRACTION FOCUS:

**ROLES (WHO)** - Based on Oakley & Cocking (2001), Dennis et al. (2016), Kong et al. (2020):
- Provider-Client Roles: Service delivery relationships with duties of competence and care
- Professional Peer Roles: Collegial relationships with mentoring and review obligations
- Employer Relationship Roles: Organizational relationships balancing loyalty and independence
- Public Responsibility Roles: Societal obligations that can override client/employer interests

**RESOURCES (WHAT)** - Based on McLaren (2003) extensional principles:
- Professional Codes: Identity-establishing frameworks for professional conduct
- Case Precedents: Documented cases providing analogical reasoning patterns
- Expert Interpretations: Authoritative guidance bridging principles to practice
- Technical Standards: Consensus on acceptable professional practice

GUIDELINE TEXT:
{text}

INTEGRATED ANALYSIS:
Extract both roles and resources, considering:
1. How roles utilize specific resources for decision-making
2. Which resources govern particular role obligations
