# ProEthica Development Progress

## Collapsible Panels for Agent Window (2025-04-12)

### Completed Tasks:

1. **Modular Panel Implementation**:
   - Created separate templates in the agent_module:
     - `app/agent_module/templates/history_panel.html` for conversation history
     - `app/agent_module/templates/guidelines_panel.html` for world guidelines
   - Integrated both panels into main agent window using template inclusion
   - Established proper module separation for better maintenance

2. **Collapsible Functionality for Both Panels**:
   - Added toggle buttons to expand/collapse both history and guidelines panels
   - Implemented smooth transition animations with CSS
   - Created intelligent column width management:
     - When both panels expanded: History (3) + Chat (6) + Guidelines (3)
     - When one panel collapsed: Collapsed panel (1) + Chat (8) + Other panel (3)
     - When both panels collapsed: History (1) + Chat (10) + Guidelines (1)
   - Added compact collapsed views showing only toggle controls

3. **Template Organization Improvements**:
   - Relocated templates to maintain proper module boundaries
   - Fixed template inclusion paths to correctly reference agent_module templates
   - Ensured proper component separation while maintaining visual consistency

4. **User Preference Persistence**:
   - Added localStorage persistence for both panel states
   - Automatically restores user's preferred layout on page reload

### Current Status:
The agent interface now features collapsible panels on both sides, giving users full control over their workspace layout. Users can maximize the chat area when needed while maintaining quick access to both conversation history and guidelines through intuitive toggle controls.

### Next Steps To Consider:

1. **Enhanced User Experience**:
   - Add keyboard shortcuts for toggling panel states
   - Implement hover preview functionality for collapsed panels
   - Add animations for panel content to improve visual feedback

2. **Panel Feature Enhancements**:
   - Add conversation filtering and search within history panel
   - Implement guidelines section navigation/jumps for quick reference
   - Add content highlighting for key information in guidelines

3. **Further Template Organization**:
   - Review other components for potential modularization
   - Consider extracting the chat window itself as a separate component
   - Standardize template locations for all agent module components

## Authentication Implementation for Agent Routes (2025-04-11)

### Completed Tasks:

1. **Modular Architecture Implemented**:
   - Created a complete set of interfaces in `app/agent_module/interfaces/base.py`
   - Developed conversation models in `app/agent_module/models/conversation.py`
   - Built authentication services in `app/agent_module/services/auth.py`
   - Implemented session management in `app/agent_module/services/session.py`
   - Created ProEthica-specific adapters in `app/agent_module/adapters/proethica.py`
   - Implemented blueprint factory in `app/agent_module/blueprints/agent.py`
   - Added package initialization with convenience functions in `app/agent_module/__init__.py`

2. **Authentication Features**:
   - Integrated with Flask-Login for secured routes
   - Added configurable authentication requiring login for all agent routes
   - Implemented option to disable authentication for development/testing
   - Created test suite with mocked components in `tests/test_agent_module.py`
   - Added documentation in `app/agent_module/README.md`

3. **Tests and Verification**:
   - Unit tests confirm that authentication is enforced when enabled
   - Tests verify that authentication can be disabled for specific scenarios
   - Manual testing confirmed redirects to login page when unauthenticated
   - Server logs verified proper 302 redirects for protected routes

### Current Status:
The agent module is integrated into the main application and working correctly. All routes under `/agent/` now require authentication by default. The implementation is modular and follows clean design principles.

### Next Steps To Consider:

1. **Enhanced Authentication Options**:
   - Add role-based access control (RBAC) for agent routes
   - Implement API token-based authentication for programmatic access
   - Add authentication audit logging for security monitoring

2. **UI Improvements**:
   - Create login/logout directly within the agent UI
   - Add user profile and settings within agent interface
   - Implement customized error pages for authentication failures

3. **Advanced Features**:
   - Add multi-factor authentication support
   - Implement session timeout and automatic logout
   - Add IP-based access restrictions for sensitive agent operations

4. **Documentation Enhancements**:
   - Create visual guide for authentication workflow
   - Add swagger/OpenAPI documentation for API endpoints
   - Create developer guide for extending authentication system

5. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Add caching for authenticated sessions
   - Optimize database queries in auth adapters
   - Implement connection pooling for auth providers

## Next Project To Consider:

Based on the current state of the application, these might be good features to implement next:

1. **Agent Personalization**: Allow users to customize their agent experience
2. **Export/Import Capabilities**: Enable sharing of agent conversations 
3. **Batch Processing**: Add ability to run agent against multiple inputs
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Track agent performance and usage patterns
5. **Integration with External Systems**: Add connectors to common enterprise systems
