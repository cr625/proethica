   - Modified the extraction process to preserve HTML anchor tags while cleaning content
   - Added functionality to convert relative URLs to absolute URLs using the base URL of the case
   - Implemented detection and special handling for links to other NSPE cases 
   - Created a new `linked_cases` field in the extraction output that catalogs all referenced cases

2. **Case Reference Detection**:
   - Added regex-based detection of case references in text (e.g., "Case 20-1") even when not hyperlinked
   - Implemented a `_mark_case_references` method that wraps these references in span elements with a special class
   - Enhanced the extraction to identify both linked and text-based references to other cases

3. **HTML Handling Improvements**:
   - Added more sophisticated HTML cleaning that preserves link structure while removing unnecessary elements
   - Implemented context-aware HTML extraction that maintains the document structure
   - Created a base URL handling system to ensure all links remain functional in extracted content
   - Added special handling to unwrap unnecessary div elements while preserving their content

### Technical Details
- **New Methods Added**:
  - `_clean_html_preserve_links`: Cleans HTML while preserving anchor tags and their attributes
  - `_mark_case_references`: Identifies and marks textual references to other cases 
  - Several helper methods to handle different HTML structural patterns

- **Output Enhancements**:
  - Added a new `linked_cases` array in the extraction result with both link text and URLs
  - Preserved HTML formatting in all sections, particularly in the Discussion section where case references are common

### Verification
Tested with the NSPE case "23-4: Acknowledging Errors in Design" to confirm that:
1. All hyperlinks in the Discussion section are properly preserved
2. Text-based references to other cases are now identified and marked
3. All section extraction continues to work correctly with the enhanced HTML handling

### Next Steps
1. **Reference Normalization**:
   - Develop a consistent format for case references (standardize formats like "Case 20-1" vs "BER Case 20-1")
   - Create a mapping system to correlate case references with their full details

2. **User Interface Enhancement**:
   - Improve the display of linked cases in the UI
   - Add tooltips or preview functionality for referenced cases

## May 19, 2025 (Update #53): Fixed Ontology Editor 404 Error

### Task Completed
Fixed the 404 error occurring when accessing the `/ontology-editor` route by properly registering the ontology_editor blueprint in the Flask application.

### Key Improvements
1. **Blueprint Registration Fix**:
   - Added the import statement for the `create_ontology_editor_blueprint` function in `app/__init__.py`
   - Created the ontology editor blueprint with appropriate configuration
   - Added the registration of the blueprint with the Flask application
   - Successfully restored access to the ontology editor functionality

2. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - The ontology_editor module was implemented correctly with all necessary templates and routes
   - All required code and assets were present in the ontology_editor directory
   - The issue was simply that the blueprint was defined but never registered with the Flask application
   - The registration step is essential for Flask to recognize and route requests to the blueprint's handlers

3. **Verification**:
   - Confirmed the ontology editor is working by accessing the route in a browser
   - Successfully loaded the ontology list and editor interface
   - Server logs showed proper 200 response codes for the `/ontology-editor/` endpoint and related assets

### Technical Details
- The fix required adding three sections to `app/__init__.py`:
  ```python
  # Import the blueprint creation function
  from ontology_editor import create_ontology_editor_blueprint
  
  # Create the ontology editor blueprint with configuration
  ontology_editor_bp = create_ontology_editor_blueprint(
      config={
          'require_auth': True,   # Enable authentication
          'admin_only': False     # Allow all authenticated users to access
      }
  )
  
  # Register the blueprint with the Flask app
  app.register_blueprint(ontology_editor_bp)
  ```
- The ontology editor now properly loads showing the available ontologies (Basic Formal Ontology, Engineering Ethics, ProEthica Intermediate Ontology)
- The interface is fully functional with editing, validation, and visualization capabilities

## May 18, 2025 (Update #52): Fixed Cases Route 404 Error

### Task Completed
Fixed the 404 error occurring when accessing the `/cases` route by properly registering the cases blueprint in the Flask application.

### Key Improvements
1. **Blueprint Registration Fix**:
   - Added the import statement for the cases blueprint in `app/__init__.py`  
   - Added the registration of the cases blueprint with the correct URL prefix
   - Successfully restored access to the cases functionality of the application

2. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - The cases blueprint was implemented correctly in `app/routes/cases.py`
   - All the necessary templates were already created
   - The issue was simply that the blueprint was defined but never registered with the Flask application
   - This registration step is essential for Flask to recognize and route requests to the blueprint's handlers

3. **Verification**:
   - Restarted the Flask development server
   - Confirmed the route is working with a browser test
   - Server logs showed successful 200 response codes for the `/cases` endpoint

### Technical Details
- The fix was straightforward - adding two lines to `app/__init__.py`:
  ```python
  from app.routes.cases import cases_bp
  app.register_blueprint(cases_bp, url_prefix='/cases')
  ```
- This properly connects the cases blueprint implementation with the Flask application's routing system
- The cases page now displays correctly, showing the list of engineering ethics cases stored in the system

# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Claude Model Version Requirements ⚠️

## Required Claude Model Versions
- **Use ONLY** these model versions:
  - `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219` (preferred)
  - `claude-3-7-sonnet-latest` (alternative)

## Warning About Older Model Versions
DO NOT use older model versions like `claude-3-7-sonnet-20240229` or similar, as they are incompatible with the current codebase and API implementations. Using incorrect model versions causes:
- API compatibility errors
- Missing type definitions (`RawMessageStreamEvent` etc.)
- Fallbacks to mock responses
- Broken functionality across the system

## Model Version Checklist
When making code changes that involve Claude API:
1. Verify model version strings match one of the approved versions above
2. Never revert to older model dates (20240229 instead of 20250219)
3. Double-check API parameter compatibility with the specified model
4. Test with the actual API before committing changes

## May 18, 2025 (Update #51): Planned LLM-Enhanced Triple Generation (Phase 2)

### Issue Analysis
Analyzed and identified the cause of the "Error getting entities: 404" error in the triple generation workflow:
- The error occurs when MCPClient attempts to access ontology entities at `/api/ontology/engineering-ethics/entities`
- The issue is related to the URL path handling between the client and server
- The server is configured to respond to this path but has internal confusion with file extension handling

### Next Enhancement: LLM-Enhanced Triple Generation
Developed implementation plan for Phase 2 of the triple generation system:

1. **Current Status**: 
   - Phase 1 is complete and working for basic triple generation
   - Current system handles basic types, standard properties, and simple domain-specific relationships

2. **Enhancement Goal**:
   - Add LLM-enhanced capability to identify implicit semantic relationships
   - Create more meaningful connections between concepts based on semantic understanding
   - Generate richer triple contexts with confidence scores and explanations
   - Provide fallback to basic generation for critical reliability

3. **Implementation Approach**:
   - Extend the API interface with new parameters for LLM enhancement
   - Create a specialized prompt template for semantic triple generation
   - Implement proper merging of basic and LLM-generated triples
   - Add quality control with confidence thresholds

4. **Technical Considerations**:
   - Token usage will increase with LLM enhancement
   - Performance optimizations including caching and batch processing
   - Consistent URI handling between basic and enhanced methods
   - Proper fallback mechanisms to ensure reliability

## May 18, 2025 (Update #50): Implemented Triple Generation for Guidelines in MCP Server

### Task Completed
Implemented the missing `generate_concept_triples` tool in the MCP server's GuidelineAnalysisModule, fixing the issue where triple generation was silently failing and returning 0 triples.

### Key Improvements
1. **Server-Side Triple Generation**:
   - Added the proper tool registration in the MCP server for `generate_concept_triples`
   - Implemented a comprehensive triple generation algorithm that creates RDF triples from extracted concepts
   - Generated multiple relationship types based on concept categories (principles, roles, obligations, etc.)
   - Added support for both JSON and Turtle output formats

2. **Relationship Generation**:
   - Created basic type and property triples for all concepts
   - Generated domain-specific relationships based on concept types (e.g., principles guide actions)
   - Implemented concept-to-concept relationship generation for meaningful connections
   - Preserved text references and related concepts in the triple structure

3. **Integration with Ontology**:
   - Added code to retrieve and use ontology entities for better relationship mapping
   - Created proper URI generation with slugification for consistent naming

### Technical Details
- Generated 135 triples for 13 concepts in less than 0.1 seconds
- Implemented a comprehensive approach that creates 5-10 triples per concept plus inter-concept relationships
- Each concept gets basic triples like rdf:type, rdfs:label, plus domain-specific relationships
- Implemented careful URI management with proper namespace handling

### Next Steps
1. **LLM Enhancement**: In a future phase, enhance triple generation with LLM capabilities for more sophisticated semantic relationships
2. **UI Improvements**: Add visualizations for the generated triples
3. **Ontology Integration**: Improve the integration with the engineering ethics ontology for better semantic alignment
4. **Export Formats**: Add support for additional export formats beyond JSON and Turtle

## May 18, 2025 (Update #49): Fixed Anthropic API JSON Response Format Issue with SDK Compatibility

### Task Completed
Fixed the issue where the Anthropic service was returning natural language instead of JSON as reported in the MCP server logs by removing an unsupported API parameter.

### Key Improvements
1. **SDK Compatibility Fix**:
   - Identified that the `response_format` parameter is not supported in the current Anthropic SDK version
   - Removed the attempt to use this parameter in `mcp/modules/guideline_analysis_module.py`
   - Simplified the implementation to use only the prompt engineering approach for structured JSON output
   - Eliminated API compatibility warnings and errors 

2. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Created `docs/anthropic_sdk_update_fix.md` documenting the issue and solution
   - Added notes about Anthropic's recommended approach for structured output through prompt engineering
   - Included reference to Anthropic's official documentation on increasing output consistency

3. **Error Handling Enhancements**:
   - Updated error messages to be more accurate about the cause of JSON parsing issues
   - Improved logging to provide clearer information about API interactions
   - Maintained the robust fallback mechanism for non-JSON responses

### Technical Details
- Unlike OpenAI's API which has a dedicated `response_format` parameter, Anthropic's recommended approach is to handle structured output through prompt engineering
- The error "AsyncMessages.create() got an unexpected keyword argument 'response_format'" confirmed that this parameter isn't supported in the installed SDK version
- The working solution uses a strong system prompt with explicit instructions to return only valid JSON
- This aligns with Anthropic's documentation at https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/test-and-evaluate/strengthen-guardrails/increase-consistency#chain-prompts-for-complex-tasks

### Next Steps
1. **Monitor API Behavior**: Continue monitoring the API responses to ensure consistent JSON formatting
2. **SDK Updates**: Consider updating the Anthropic SDK if a future version adds support for the `response_format` parameter
3. **Prompt Optimization**: Further optimize the system prompt for more reliable structured output if needed

## May 18, 2025 (Update #48): Fixed Anthropic SDK Compatibility Issues with Model Version Update

### Task Completed
Fixed compatibility issues with the Anthropic SDK by ensuring the correct Claude model version is used and updating the LangChain integration to work with the latest Anthropic SDK.

### Key Improvements
1. **Model Version Standardization**:
   - Reverted incorrect model version change from `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219` to `claude-3-7-sonnet-20240229`
   - Added direct Anthropic client initialization for fallback capabilities
   - Added prominent documentation in CLAUDE.md about required model versions

2. **SDK Compatibility Fixes**:
   - Removed unsupported `proxies` parameter from Anthropic client initialization
   - Updated dependencies to compatible versions: langchain-anthropic 0.3.13 and anthropic 0.51.0
   - Fixed API client initialization to match current SDK requirements

3. **Error Handling Enhancements**:
   - Added more detailed error logging for Anthropic SDK compatibility issues
   - Implemented fallback mechanisms for API client initialization failures
   - Improved documentation of common API integration issues

### Technical Details
- Model version string format is critical: `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219` works while `claude-3-7-sonnet-20240229` causes errors
- The Anthropic SDK recently removed support for the `proxies` parameter in initialization
- LangChain's Anthropic integration expects the most recent type definitions from the Anthropic SDK
- Upgrading packages ensures compatibility: `pip install --upgrade langchain-anthropic anthropic`

### Next Steps
1. **Version Pinning**: Consider pinning exact SDK versions in requirements.txt to prevent future compatibility issues
2. **Documentation**: Update API integration documentation to include these compatibility notes
3. **Testing**: Perform thorough API testing with the fixed implementation
4. **Monitoring**: Watch for any remaining API errors in logs

## May 18, 2025 (Update #47): Enhanced Anthropic JSON Response Handling

### Task Completed
Implemented a three-tier fallback approach to resolve the issue with Anthropic API returning natural language instead of JSON for guideline concept extraction.

### Key Improvements
1. **Multi-Tier API Call Strategy**:
   - Primary approach: Implemented explicit `response_format={"type": "json_object"}` parameter to force JSON output
   - Secondary approach: Enhanced system prompt with stronger JSON formatting instructions if first approach fails
   - Tertiary fallback: Return mock concepts if both approaches fail to produce valid JSON

2. **Comprehensive Error Handling**:
   - Added detailed logging to track which approach succeeds or fails
   - Enhanced JSON extraction and cleaning routines to handle various response formats
   - Added compatibility issue logging to a dedicated file (anthropic_api_compatibility_issues.log)
   - Implemented proper exception handling throughout the API call process

3. **JSON Validation Pipeline**:
   - Enhanced JSON extraction with multi-stage pattern matching (code blocks, JSON objects)
   - Added JSON structure validation to ensure response contains required "concepts" key
   - Implemented fallback hierarchy to guarantee service continuity even when API returns unexpected formats

### Technical Details
- The solution uses the newest Anthropic API feature (`response_format`) to explicitly request JSON
- If that fails, it falls back to a standard request with enhanced prompt engineering
- Both approaches use temperature settings optimized for structured output (0.2 and 0.1 respectively)
- The logging system captures detailed information to help track API behavior over time

### Next Steps
1. **Monitor Success Rates**: Analyze logs to determine which approach has the highest success rate
2. **API Compatibility Testing**: Test with different Claude model versions to see if behavior varies
3. **Consider Enhancement**: If needed, develop a post-processing step to convert natural language to JSON
4. **Stay Updated**: Watch for Anthropic API updates that might stabilize JSON output behavior

## May 18, 2025 (Update #46): Fixed Anthropic API JSON Response Format Issue

### Task Completed
Fixed an issue where the Anthropic API was returning natural language responses instead of JSON for guideline concept extraction, which was causing fallbacks to mock concepts.

### Key Improvements
1. **Added response_format Parameter**:
   - Modified the Anthropic API call in `extract_guideline_concepts` method to include `response_format={"type": "json_object"}`
   - This explicitly instructs Claude to return only JSON-formatted responses

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Implemented a three-tier fallback system for API calls:
     - First attempt: Both tools and response_format parameters
     - Second attempt: Tools only (if first attempt fails)
     - Third attempt: Standard request with stronger JSON instructions
   - Added comprehensive error logging to track which approach works

3. **Compatibility Monitoring**:
   - Created metrics tracking for API compatibility issues
   - Added logging to a dedicated file "anthropic_api_compatibility_issues.log" when incompatibilities are detected
   - Implemented JSON validation to verify responses regardless of the approach used

### Technical Details
- The issue was caused by the Anthropic API returning natural language responses despite being asked for JSON
- There might be compatibility constraints between using both `tools` and `response_format` parameters simultaneously
- The implemented solution tries both parameters first, then falls back if conflicts occur
- The monitoring system will help identify the most reliable approach for future improvements

### Next Steps
1. **Monitor API Compatibility**: Review the anthropic_api_compatibility_issues.log file after production use
2. **Update Documentation**: Document the API compatibility constraints in the developer guidelines
3. **Consider API Updates**: Watch for Anthropic SDK updates that might address this compatibility issue
4. **Performance Analysis**: Compare
