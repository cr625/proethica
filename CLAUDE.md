## Claude API Configuration and Testing (2025-04-21)

### Completed Tasks:

1. **Claude API Configuration Improvements**:
   - Added comprehensive Claude API configuration documentation in `scripts/claude_api_info.md`
   - Created utility script `scripts/run_with_env.sh` to properly export environment variables from .env file
   - Implemented secured testing scripts without hardcoded API keys:
     - `scripts/debug_anthropic.py`: Detailed diagnostics for API connectivity issues
     - `scripts/simple_claude_test.py`: Minimal test script for basic functionality
     - `scripts/test_anthropic_auth.py`: Tests multiple authentication methods
   - Fixed API key handling to use secure environment variables instead of hardcoded keys

### Current Status:
Claude API integration has been improved with better documentation and secure API key handling. All testing scripts now load API keys from environment variables, avoiding security issues from hardcoded keys. The provided utility scripts make it easier to diagnose and troubleshoot Claude API connectivity issues.

### Next Steps To Consider:

   - Uncommented and enabled agent blueprint registration in app/__init__.py
   - Configured agent module with proper settings for the application
   - Added routes for agent window and conversation history

### Current Status:
The agent module is now properly integrated into the ProEthica application, enabling the conversational agent interface that was previously unavailable. The agent routes (/agent/) are now accessible and functional with the dockerized PostgreSQL database.

### Next Steps To Consider:

1. **Agent Customization**:
   - Customize agent prompts and templates for specific ethical contexts
   - Create training materials for using the agent interface effectively
   - Set up automated tests for the agent module integration

2. **Feature Enhancement**:

## PostgreSQL Configuration Update (2025-04-21)

### Completed Tasks:

1. **PostgreSQL Configuration Cleanup**:
   - Removed system-installed PostgreSQL packages to avoid conflicts
   - Standardized on Docker-based PostgreSQL (pgvector image)
   - Verified database connection using port 5433 as specified in .env
   - Cleaned up unused dependencies related to the system PostgreSQL
   - Updated restore_database.sh script to work with Docker PostgreSQL on port 5433
   - Successfully tested database restoration procedure

### Current Status:
The application now exclusively uses Docker-based PostgreSQL with pgvector support. This provides a cleaner environment with reduced potential for port conflicts and ensures consistency across development environments.

### Next Steps To Consider:

1. **Database Documentation**:
   - Update setup documentation to clarify Docker-based PostgreSQL requirements
   - Document database backup/restore procedures for the Docker configuration
   - Create scripts to simplify container management for development

2. **Environment Standardization**:
   - Ensure consistent database setup across all deployment environments
   - Create database initialization scripts for fresh installations
   - Update CI/CD pipelines to align with the Docker-based setup

## Docker PostgreSQL Integration (2025-04-21)

### Completed Tasks:

1. **Docker Container Management**:
   - Added automated Docker PostgreSQL container checks to `start_proethica.sh`
   - Implemented container status detection and auto-starting capability
   - Added port extraction from .env file to ensure consistent container configuration
   - Included informative error messages and instructions for container creation
   - Added a short delay after container startup to allow PostgreSQL to initialize

### Current Status:
The application startup script now automatically checks for and starts the Docker PostgreSQL container if it's not running. This ensures the database is ready before the application attempts to connect, reducing startup errors and improving the developer experience. The script provides clear error messages and instructions if Docker is not available or the container doesn't exist.

### Next Steps To Consider:

1. **Further Docker Integration**:
   - Add similar container management to other scripts like `run_proethica_with_agents.sh`
   - Create a dedicated container management script for more complex operations
   - Add volume mounting for persistent data across container restarts
   - Implement container health checks beyond simple status checking

## Dependency Management Improvements (2025-04-21)

### Completed Tasks:

1. **Dependency Organization and Management**:
   - Created categorized requirements files:
     - `requirements-final.txt`: Organized by feature with detailed comments
     - `requirements-cleaned.txt`: Initial analysis of dependencies
   - Developed dependency management utility script:
     - `scripts/manage_dependencies.py`: Tool to selectively install dependencies
   - Added comprehensive documentation in `docs/dependency_management.md`

2. **CUDA Dependencies Optimization**:
   - Identified and categorized heavy dependencies with CUDA requirements
   - Created feature-specific installation options to avoid unnecessary packages
   - Implemented detection of active features based on .env configuration
   - Enabled selective installation of only required dependencies

3. **Feature Detection and Configuration**:
   - Added automatic detection of active features based on .env settings
   - Created analysis command to show which features are active
   - Provided clear installation commands for different deployment scenarios

### Current Status:
The application now has an improved dependency management system that allows developers to install only the dependencies needed for active features. This reduces overhead from unnecessary packages, particularly those with heavy CUDA dependencies.

### Next Steps To Consider:

1. **Containerization Improvements**:
   - Update Docker configurations to use the new dependency management approach
   - Create specialized Docker images for different feature sets
   - Optimize container sizes by excluding unnecessary dependencies

3. **Environment Templates**:
   - Create template .env files for common deployment scenarios
   - Add environment configuration presets to the dependency script
   - Document common deployment patterns with corresponding dependency sets

## Collapsible Panels for Agent Window (2025-04-12)

### Completed Tasks:

1. **Modular Panel Implementation**:
   - Created separate templates in the agent_module:
     - `app/agent_module/templates/history_panel.html` for conversation history
     - `app/agent_module/templates/guidelines_panel.html` for world guidelines
   - Integrated both panels into main agent window using template inclusion
   - Established proper module separation for better maintenance

2. **Collapsible Functionality for Both Panels**:
   - Added toggle buttons to expand/collapse both history and guidelines panels
   - Implemented smooth transition animations with CSS
   - Created intelligent column width management:
     - When both panels expanded: History (3) + Chat (6) + Guidelines (3)
     - When one panel collapsed: Collapsed panel (1) + Chat (8) + Other panel (3)
     - When both panels collapsed: History (1) + Chat (10) + Guidelines (1)
   - Added compact collapsed views showing only toggle controls

3. **Template Organization Improvements**:
   - Relocated templates to maintain proper module boundaries
   - Fixed template inclusion paths to correctly reference agent_module templates
   - Ensured proper component separation while maintaining visual consistency

4. **User Preference Persistence**:
   - Added localStorage persistence for both panel states
   - Automatically restores user's preferred layout on page reload

### Current Status:
The agent interface now features collapsible panels on both sides, giving users full control over their workspace layout. Users can maximize the chat area when needed while maintaining quick access to both conversation history and guidelines through intuitive toggle controls.

### Next Steps To Consider:

1. **Enhanced User Experience**:
   - Add keyboard shortcuts for toggling panel states
   - Implement hover preview functionality for collapsed panels
   - Add animations for panel content to improve visual feedback
