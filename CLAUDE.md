# ProEthica Development Log

## 2025-05-11: Created Ontology-Focused Branch

Created a new branch based on the realm-integration branch to focus on enhancing the ontology functionality of ProEthica. This branch is specifically focused on developing ontology-based case analysis capabilities.

### Changes Made:

1. **Created ontology-focused branch** from the realm-integration branch
2. **Fixed database and MCP server configuration**:
   - Set MCP server port to 5001 in `.env` and `start_proethica_updated.sh`
   - Fixed URL escape sequence issues in the MCP client
   - Updated database connection configuration for WSL environment

3. **Created documentation**:
   - Added detailed ontology case analysis plan in `docs/ontology_case_analysis_plan.md`
   - Updated `ONTOLOGY_ENHANCEMENT_README.md` with branch information

### Next Steps:

1. Implement case analysis module in the unified ontology server
2. Create database tables for case analysis
3. Develop API endpoints for case analysis
4. Integrate with the ProEthica UI

## Future Work

As outlined in the ontology case analysis plan, future enhancements will include:

- Implementing temporal reasoning for case analysis
- Adding support for comparing multiple cases
- Developing machine learning integration for case similarity analysis
- Creating ethical reasoning enhancements based on ontology rules
