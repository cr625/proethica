## 2025-05-11: Fixing NSPE Case Import Pipeline for Ontology Triples

### Issue
When importing a new NSPE case (case 187) from URL https://www.nspe.org/career-growth/ethics/board-ethical-review-cases/acknowledging-errors-design, the case data was imported properly but the query to fetch ontology triples was not finding the triples despite them being correctly added to the database.

### Investigation

1. Created debugging tools to examine entity triples in the database:
   - `check_database_triples.py` - Low-level inspection of database structure and triple storage patterns
   - `fix_entity_triples_query.py` - Updated query tool using correct subject URI pattern

2. Discovered that triples were being stored with:
   - `subject = "http://proethica.org/cases/{case_id}"`
   - `entity_type = 'document'`
   - `temporal_region_type = NULL` (not set to the case ID as expected)

3. The query code in `correct_query_triples.py` was looking for triples using the pattern:
   ```python
   cursor.execute("""
       SELECT id, subject, predicate, object_uri, object_literal, is_literal, 
              graph, triple_metadata, temporal_region_type
       FROM entity_triples
       WHERE entity_type = 'document' AND temporal_region_type = %s
       ORDER BY graph, predicate
   """, (str(case_id),))
   ```

4. Updated the query to use the correct pattern:
   ```python
   case_uri = f"http://proethica.org/cases/{case_id}"
   cursor.execute("""
       SELECT id, subject, predicate, object_uri, object_literal, is_literal, 
              graph, triple_metadata, temporal_region_type
       FROM entity_triples
       WHERE subject = %s AND entity_type = 'document'
       ORDER BY graph, predicate
   """, (case_uri,))
   ```

5. Verified that case 188 had 14 triples (13 from engineering-ethics ontology and 1 from mclaren-extensional-definitions).

### Findings

The pipeline itself is correctly adding both engineering world entity triples and McLaren extensional definition triples to imported cases. The issue was in how these triples were being queried.

The ontology integration happens in step 8 of the NSPE case processing pipeline through the `integrate_ontologies_with_case()` function:
   - Adds engineering world entities to the case via `add_engineering_world_entities()`
   - Adds McLaren extensional definitions to the case via `add_mclaren_extensional_definitions()`

### Documentation and Fixes

1. Created a comprehensive document `nspe-pipeline-update.md` describing:
   - The pipeline flow
   - The triple storage pattern
   - The issue with the entity triple queries
   - Recommendations for fixing and improving the system

2. Fixed the query script `correct_query_triples.py` to properly query triples.

### Next Steps

1. Update all triple query code (such as in `app/routes/cases.py`) to use the subject URI pattern for finding case-related triples.

2. Consider adding a database migration to populate the `temporal_region_type` field with the case ID for consistency.

3. Update the `EntityTripleService` code to ensure triples stored by that service consistently use the same pattern as the ontology integration code.

### Conclusion

The NSPE case import pipeline is working correctly for importing ontology triples. The issue was in the query method. By updating the query to use the correct pattern, we can now correctly retrieve the engineering ethics and McLaren ontology triples for cases.
