## 2025-04-25: Ontology Visualization Implementation

Fixed the ontology visualization system to properly display ontologies in a hierarchical view:

1. **Fixed API Authentication**: Modified `is_authorized()` in `ontology_editor/api/routes.py` to exempt visualization-related endpoints from strict authentication requirements.

2. **API Route Standardization**: Added compatibility endpoints to support both `/api/ontology/:id` and `/api/ontologies/:id` route patterns to ensure backwards compatibility with client code.

3. **Fixed Client JavaScript**: Updated the editor.js to correctly use the standardized API endpoints, removing duplicated API URL resolution code that was causing conflicts.

4. **Added Testing Utility**: Created `scripts/check_ontology_visualization.py` to verify endpoint functionality and test the visualization rendering.

5. **Added Documentation**: Created `docs/ontology_visualization_readme.md` with comprehensive documentation on the visualization system.

The visualization can now be accessed at:
```
http://localhost:3333/ontology-editor/visualize/{ontology_id}
```

### Known Issues & Limitations

- The current visualization is read-only (viewing only)
- D3.js visualization can be enhanced with more interactive features
- Some browser environments may have trouble with the puppeteer-based browser integration for testing

### Next Steps

1. Enhance the visualization with drag-and-drop editing capability
2. Add search functionality to find specific entities
3. Implement more sophisticated RDF parsing for detailed hierarchy extraction
4. Optimize performance for large ontologies with pagination and lazy-loading

## 2025-04-24: Admin Role Support

Added support for admin roles in the user model:

1. Created `scripts/admin_migration.py` to add `is_admin` column to users table
2. Updated authentication logic to check for admin status when required
3. First user (system admin) is automatically granted admin privileges
