3. **Environment Templates**:
   - Create template .env files for common deployment scenarios
   - Add environment configuration presets to the dependency script
   - Document common deployment patterns with corresponding dependency sets

## Collapsible Panels for Agent Window (2025-04-12)

### Completed Tasks:

1. **Modular Panel Implementation**:
   - Created separate templates in the agent_module:
     - `app/agent_module/templates/history_panel.html` for conversation history
     - `app/agent_module/templates/guidelines_panel.html` for world guidelines
   - Integrated both panels into main agent window using template inclusion
   - Established proper module separation for better maintenance

2. **Collapsible Functionality for Both Panels**:
   - Added toggle buttons to expand/collapse both history and guidelines panels
   - Implemented smooth transition animations with CSS
   - Created intelligent column width management:
     - When both panels expanded: History (3) + Chat (6) + Guidelines (3)
     - When one panel collapsed: Collapsed panel (1) + Chat (8) + Other panel (3)
     - When both panels collapsed: History (1) + Chat (10) + Guidelines (1)
   - Added compact collapsed views showing only toggle controls

3. **Template Organization Improvements**:
   - Relocated templates to maintain proper module boundaries
   - Fixed template inclusion paths to correctly reference agent_module templates
   - Ensured proper component separation while maintaining visual consistency

4. **User Preference Persistence**:
   - Added localStorage persistence for both panel states
   - Automatically restores user's preferred layout on page reload

### Current Status:
The agent interface now features collapsible panels on both sides, giving users full control over their workspace layout. Users can maximize the chat area when needed while maintaining quick access to both conversation history and guidelines through intuitive toggle controls.

### Next Steps To Consider:

1. **Enhanced User Experience**:
   - Add keyboard shortcuts for toggling panel states
   - Implement hover preview functionality for collapsed panels
   - Add animations for panel content to improve visual feedback

2. **Panel Feature Enhancements**:
   - Add conversation filtering and search within history panel
   - Implement guidelines section navigation/jumps for quick reference
   - Add content highlighting for key information in guidelines

3. **Further Template Organization**:
   - Review other components for potential modularization
   - Consider extracting the chat window itself as a separate component
   - Standardize template locations for all agent module components
