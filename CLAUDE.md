# AI Ethical DM Development Progress

## Case Document Structure Enhancement Project

### Current Status (May 20, 2025)
- **Phase 1 Complete**: Extended ontology with document structure classes and properties
- **Phase 2.1-2.2 Complete**: 
  - Implemented DocumentStructureAnnotationStep pipeline component
  - Created integration files and example implementation
  - Successfully tested with mock case data
- **Next Steps**:
  - Complete pipeline integration in production code
  - Update document storage schema for structure triples
  - Implement section-level embeddings

### Implementation Details

We've successfully implemented the document structure annotation step for the case processing pipeline. This enhancement:

1. **Creates semantic markup** of case documents using our ontology
2. **Structures case content** into well-defined sections (Facts, Questions, Discussion, References, Conclusion)
3. **Prepares for section-level embeddings** to enable more granular similarity search
4. **Establishes relationships** between document parts following BFO principles

The implementation includes:

- New pipeline step class: `DocumentStructureAnnotationStep`
- Integration test: `test_document_structure_step.py` (standalone test)
- Pipeline integration test: `test_integrate_document_structure_step.py`
- Integration guide: `app/routes/update_pipeline_route.py`

### Testing Results

Our mock test case (with 82 generated triples) successfully:
- Creates a document entity with proper URI
- Identifies and classifies all document sections
- Extracts and associates individual questions and conclusions
- Establishes document sequence relationships
- Prepares metadata for section-level embeddings

### Ontological Approach

We've modeled document sections as generically dependent continuants in the BFO framework. This means:
- Sections are entities that depend on the document but aren't tied to a specific physical manifestation
- They maintain identity across different representations (HTML, text, etc.)
- They can have complex relationships to other entities in our ontology

### Embedding Strategy

We're implementing a dual embedding approach:
1. **Document-level embeddings** (existing): For overall case similarity
2. **Section-level embeddings** (new): For more granular comparison

This will allow us to answer queries like:
- "Find cases with similar facts but different conclusions"
- "Find cases with similar ethical questions addressed"
- "Compare discussions between related cases"

### Next Phase

Ready to implement Phase 2.3: Complete production integration
