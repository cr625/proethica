## 2025-04-24: Added Dismiss Button to Validation Results

Enhanced the validation results interface with a close button:

### Changes Made:
1. **Added Close Button to Validation Results**:
   - Added a dismissible close button in the validation results card header
   - Added event listener to hide the validation card when clicked
   - Styled the button to match the card's color scheme with white close icon
   - Improved overall user experience with better UI controls

2. **UI Styling Enhancements**:
   - Added distinctive blue header to validation results card
   - Enhanced spacing and positioning for better readability
   - Added proper z-indexing to ensure validation results display correctly

### Previous Issues Fixed:
- Users had no way to dismiss validation results without re-validating or reloading
- Validation results would remain visible until another action was taken

### Next Steps:
- Consider adding animations for smoother transitions when opening/closing validation results
- Consider adding keyboard shortcuts for common actions like validating and dismissing results

## 2025-04-24: Fixed Ontology Editor Validation UI and API Consistency

Fixed validation issues in the ontology editor that were causing UI problems and error messages:

### Changes Made:
1. **Fixed CSS for Validation Results Display**:
   - Modified CSS properties to prevent validation button from being cropped
   - Changed `overflow-x: hidden` to `overflow-x: visible` to ensure proper rendering
   - Added `white-space: normal` to ensure proper text wrapping in validation results

2. **Fixed API/UI Property Name Inconsistency**:
   - Unified property name between validator, API routes, and client-side JavaScript
   - Standardized on `is_valid` property name throughout the system
   - Added consistent error, warning, and suggestions structure to validation responses
   - Improved API error handling and debugging with additional logging

3. **Fixed JavaScript Validation Logic**:
   - Corrected JavaScript to use the dedicated validation endpoint instead of update endpoint
   - Updated logic to match the correct property names returned by the API
   - Improved error handling for validation responses
   - Added more detailed logging to diagnose issues

4. **Created Test Tools**:
   - Added `validate_ontology_syntax.py` script to validate and debug ontology syntax issues
   - Created `test_ontology_editor.py` to quickly test changes to the ontology editor

### Previous Issues Fixed:
- Validate button was cropped in the UI
- Error messages were incomplete or inconsistent due to property name mismatch
- Validation API was using inconsistent property names (`valid` vs `is_valid`)
- Error details weren't properly displayed in the UI

### Next Steps:
- Consider adding a more comprehensive validator that provides specific line-by-line feedback
- Implement better visual indicators for validation status
- Enhance the validation to include semantic validation beyond basic syntax checking

## 2025-04-24: Migrated Ontologies to Database-Only Storage

3. **Enhanced Migration Scripts**:
   - Created script to verify ontologies are properly stored in database
   - Implemented tool to safely move ontology files to backup location
   - Ensured proper error handling during migration process

4. **Database Storage Enhancements**:
   - Created scripts to verify database storage is working properly
   - Added validation for ontology content structure
   - Ensured version history is preserved during migration

### Previous Issues Fixed:
- BuildError when accessing world detail page
- Duplicate URL paths causing 404 errors
- File system fallback creating confusion about source of truth
- Potential synchronization issues between files and database

### Next Steps:
- Monitor for any issues with database-only storage
- Implement database backup strategy for ontologies
- Consider adding performance optimizations for large ontologies
- Improve data validation during ontology updates

## 2025-04-24: Fixed UI Inconsistencies in World Detail Page and API Route References

Fixed inconsistencies in the world detail page UI and updated API route references:

### Changes Made:
1. **Fixed Button Labels in World Detail Page**:
   - Corrected the button label in the World Entities section to show "Edit Entities" instead of incorrectly showing "Edit Ontology"
   - Ensured proper URL parameters are maintained for both buttons to direct to the correct editor views

2. **Updated API Route References**:
   - Fixed document API endpoint references to match the actual implementation:
     - Changed `documents.view_document` to `api_documents.get_document`
     - Changed `documents.edit_document` to `api_documents.update_document`
     - Changed `documents.delete_document` to `api_documents.delete_document`
   - Updated parameter names for route consistency (using `document_id` instead of `doc_id` where needed)

3. **Fixed Template Structure Issues**:
   - Ensured all Jinja template blocks are properly closed
   - Fixed parameter name consistency across URL routes (using `id` instead of `world_id` in some places)
   - Corrected HTML structure to ensure proper rendering

### Previous Issues Fixed:
- Button labeling inconsistency in the World Entities section
- Template rendering errors due to incorrect endpoint references
- Jinja template syntax errors causing 500 responses

### Next Steps:

   - Improved error handling and added detailed logging

### Previous Issues Fixed:
- Fixed 404 errors when accessing ontologies via the editor
- Fixed inconsistent button labels in the world detail page
- Addressed metadata inconsistencies between ontology sources and filesystem paths
- Implemented database storage for better reliability and consistency

   - Added a dedicated route to handle ontology requests without .ttl extension
   - Updated the `get_ontology_by_source` function to properly handle both cases (with/without extension)
   - Improved logging for better debugging
   - Added automatic domain name conversion between dash and underscore formats

2. **Updated World Template**:
