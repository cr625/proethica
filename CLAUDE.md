## 2025-04-27 - Fixed Anthropic SDK Authentication Issues

### Issue Fixed

Fixed an "invalid x-api-key" error that occurred when accessing the agent page at http://localhost:3333/agent/ after updating the Anthropic SDK.

### Root Cause Analysis

Multiple factors contributed to the authentication failure:

1. Recent updates to the Anthropic SDK changed the authentication method from using x-api-key header to using an Authorization Bearer token
2. The `load_dotenv()` function alone was not sufficient for setting the environment variables needed by the SDK
3. The previous API key was invalid or expired (confirmed through multiple authentication tests)

### Solution Implemented

1. **Generated New API Key**
   - Created a new API key from the Anthropic console
   - Verified the new key works correctly with comprehensive testing
   - Added key to .env file with protection from git tracking

2. **Enhanced Environment Variable Handling**
   - Updated `ClaudeService` and `ProEthicaAdapter` to explicitly set the environment variable
   - Made sure the API key is properly passed to the SDK initialization
   - Added support for using `run_with_env.sh` script to ensure consistent env vars

3. **Improved Mock Fallback Mode**
   - Added more robust fallback mode when API authentication fails
   - Implemented graceful fallback to mock responses for conversations
   - Added helpful mock prompt suggestions when API issues occur

4. **Security and Documentation**
   - Created protection script `scripts/git_protect_keys.sh` to secure API credentials
   - Created `docs/anthropic_sdk_update_fix.md` with detailed technical documentation
   - Added verification scripts for testing authentication

5. **Startup Script Enhancements**
   - Updated `auto_run.sh` to use run_with_env.sh for proper environment handling
   - Enhanced `start_proethica.sh` to detect and use run_with_env.sh
   - Improved error recovery and environment variable management

### Modified Files
- `app/services/claude_service.py` - Enhanced environment variable handling and mock fallback
- `app/agent_module/adapters/proethica.py` - Added proper environment variable handling
- `.env` - Updated with new API key and environment configuration
- `auto_run.sh` - Updated to use run_with_env.sh for better environment variable handling
- `start_proethica.sh` - Enhanced to ensure run_with_env.sh is used when available
- `scripts/test_claude_with_env.py` - Added comprehensive test for environment handling
- `scripts/test_new_key.py` - Created script for testing new API keys safely

### Verification
Authentication is now working correctly with the real Claude API. The agent page functions properly using the authentication method required by the updated SDK.

### Usage Instructions
1. **To use the Claude API directly:**
   - Use the recommended startup script: `./start_proethica.sh`
   - This will automatically use run_with_env.sh and set up proper environment variables
   - Keep USE_MOCK_FALLBACK=false in .env

2. **For standalone scripts:**
   - Always run Python scripts with: `./scripts/run_with_env.sh python your_script.py`
   - This ensures proper environment variable handling, especially for API keys
   
3. **If authentication issues occur:**
   - Set USE_MOCK_FALLBACK=true in .env to continue functioning with mock responses

## 2025-04-27 - Comprehensive Improvements to Diff Viewer UI

### Issues Fixed and Improvements Made

1. **Fixed Container Overflow**: Content now stays within the grey background container
2. **Enhanced Horizontal Scrolling**: Added reliable, consistently visible scrollbar
3. **Removed 'X' Close Button**: Eliminated redundant 'X' in the modal header for cleaner appearance
4. **Added Diff Notation Legend**: Included an expandable legend to explain diff notation in unified view

### Root Cause Analysis

Several UI issues were identified:
1. Content extended beyond its container boundaries in side-by-side view
2. Scrollbar as inconsistent or missing when needed
3. The 'X' close button was redundant with the "Close" button in the footer
4. Unified diff notation was difficult to interpret for users unfamiliar with diff format

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Container Overflow and Scrolling

Implemented a comprehensive scrollbar solution:

```css
#diffContent {
    overflow-x: scroll;  /* Force horizontal scrolling */
    margin-bottom: 15px;  /* Space for scrollbar */
    padding-bottom: 15px;  /* Ensure scrollbar visibility */
}

/* Cross-browser styling */
#diffContent::-webkit-scrollbar { height: 8px; display: block; }
#diffContent { scrollbar-width: thin; scrollbar-color: #888 #f1f1f1; }

/* Force table width to trigger scrollbar */
#diffContent table.diff {
    min-width: 110%;  /* Wider than container to force scrollbar */
    width: max-content;  /* Natural width if wider */
    table-layout: auto;  /* Natural column widths */
}
```

#### 2. Modal Header Cleanup

Removed the redundant 'X' close button from the modal header:

```html
<div class="diff-modal-header">
    <h5 class="diff-modal-title">Compare Versions</h5>
    <input type="hidden" id="currentOntologyId" value="{{ ontology_id }}">
</div>
```

And updated the JavaScript to remove the corresponding event listener.

#### 3. Added Diff Notation Legend

Created an expandable legend for unified diff mode:

```html
<div class="diff-legend">
    <details>
        <summary>Diff notation legend</summary>
        <ul class="diff-legend-items">
            <li><code>--- Version X</code>: Source version</li>
            <li><code>+++ Version Y</code>: Target version</li>
            <li><code>@@ -X,Y +A,B @@</code>: Line ranges</li>
            <li><code>-</code>Line removed</li>
            <li><code>+</code>Line added</li>
            <li>No prefix: Context line (unchanged)</li>
        </ul>
    </details>
</div>
```

With appropriate styling:

```css
.diff-legend {
    margin-top: 10px;
    border-top: 1px solid #dee2e6;
    padding-top: 5px;
    font-size: 0.85rem;
}

.diff-legend summary {
    cursor: pointer;
    color: #6c757d;
    font-weight: 500;
}

.diff-legend-items code {
    background-color: #f8f9fa;
    padding: 1px 4px;
    border-radius: 3px;
}
```

### Benefits

- **Enhanced Usability**: Content stays properly contained with reliable scrolling
- **Cleaner Interface**: Removed redundant close button for cleaner appearance
- **Improved Understanding**: Legend helps users interpret unified diff notation
- **Consistent Cross-Browser Experience**: Reliable behavior in all browsers
- **Space Efficiency**: Collapsible legend provides help without taking up permanent space

These enhancements improve both the functionality and usability of the diff viewer while maintaining a clean, professional appearance.

## 2025-04-27 - Fixed Diff Viewer 404 Error on Direct Access

### Issue Fixed

Fixed a bug where accessing the ontology editor directly via http://localhost:3333/ontology-editor/ 
and then comparing versions would result in a 404 error:

```
Error Loading Diff
HTTP error 404: NOT FOUND
```

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue occurred because the diff viewer JavaScript needed to know which ontology ID to use 
for the API requests, but this information wasn't available when accessing the editor directly 
(as opposed to through a specific world page that passes the ontology_id parameter).

Specifically:

1. When accessing via http://localhost:3333/worlds/1 and clicking "Edit Ontology", the ontology_id (1) 
   was properly passed to the editor
2. When accessing directly via http://localhost:3333/ontology-editor/, no ontology_id was provided
3. The diff.js script had no reliable way to determine which ontology to use for API calls

### Solution Implemented

The fix was implemented with a comprehensive three-part approach:

1. **Default Ontology Selection**: Updated the ontology editor route handler to default to ontology ID 1 
   (engineering ethics) when no specific ontology is requested

2. **Enhanced Fallback Mechanism**: Improved the diff.js script with a robust fallback chain that tries:
   - The hidden input field first
   - The body data attribute second
   - URL parameters third
   - A default value of '1' as the final fallback

3. **Added Data Attribute**: Updated the editor.html template to include the ontology ID as a 
   data attribute on the body tag, ensuring it's always available to the JavaScript

### Implementation Details

- Created `scripts/fix_diff_direct_access.py` to implement all three parts of the solution
- Made backups of all modified files with appropriate timestamps
- Added better debugging information in the JavaScript console
- Improved the user experience with a helpful flash message
- Added a comprehensive fallback chain for ontology ID detection

### Verification

The fix was verified by:

1. Accessing the ontology editor directly at http://localhost:3333/ontology-editor/
2. Loading an ontology and selecting "Compare" from a version's dropdown
3. Confirming that the diff viewer loads properly with no 404 errors
4. Checking that the right diff content is displayed for the selected versions

This fix ensures that the diff viewer works correctly regardless of how users access the ontology editor.

## 2025-04-27 - Root Directory Cleanup

### Actions Taken

1. **Moved Utility Scripts to scripts/ Directory**
   - Moved reusable utility scripts from root directory to the scripts directory:
     - fix_ontology_automatically.py - Script to repair common syntax errors in ontology content
     - fix_ontology_syntax.py - Script to fix Turtle syntax issues in ontologies
     - fix_ontology_validation.py - Script to fix validation-related issues in the system

2. **Removed One-time Fix and Update Scripts**
   - Removed various one-time scripts whose changes have already been applied:
     - update_claude_md_with_navbar.py - One-time documentation update
     - update_claude_md.py - One-time documentation update
     - update_engineering_capability.py - References old .ttl files and fixes have been applied
     - update_ontology_with_capability.py - References old .ttl files

     - fix_ontology_editor_entity_link.py - One-time fix documented in CLAUDE.md
     - fix_ontology_editor_url_update.js - JavaScript fix that's been applied

3. **Created Repository Cleanup Script**
   - Added `scripts/cleanup_repository.py` to automate the cleanup process
   - Script logs all actions to a timestamped log file
   - Script creates backups of any files before moving/replacing them
   - Added `scripts/document_repository_cleanup.py` to document the cleanup

### Benefits

- Cleaner root directory with fewer unused scripts
- Better organization with reusable utility scripts in the scripts directory
- Better documentation of which fixes have already been applied
- Easier navigation of the codebase for new developers

### Implementation Details

The cleanup process moved useful general-purpose scripts to the scripts directory while
removing one-time fix scripts whose changes have already been applied to the codebase.
This helps maintain a cleaner project structure and prevents confusion about which fixes
have already been implemented.

### Next Steps

- Consider adding script categorization within the scripts directory
- Review and update docs/scripts_guide.md with new script locations
- Consider implementing a script review policy to prevent accumulation of one-time fix scripts

### Issue Fixed

Fixed JavaScript errors that occurred when comparing versions:

```
Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
    at HTMLSelectElement.<anonymous> (diff.js:91:21)
    at HTMLInputElement.<anonymous> (diff.js:44:21)
```

### Root Cause Analysis

The bug was in the version validation code in diff.js, where variables declared with `const` were later being modified:

```javascript
// Variable declared as constant
const fromVersion = document.getElementById('diffFromVersion').value;

// ...later in the code...
// Attempting to modify a constant (causes error)
fromVersion = fromVersion.toString().trim();
```

In JavaScript, variables declared with `const` cannot be reassigned after initialization, which was causing the runtime errors.

### Solution

Changed variable declarations from `const` to `let` for variables that need to be modified:

```javascript
// Changed to let to allow reassignment
let fromVersion = document.getElementById('diffFromVersion').value;

// ...later in the code...
// Now works correctly
fromVersion = fromVersion.toString().trim();
```

This fix was applied to all instances where version variables are declared but later modified:
1. In the format toggle event handler
2. In the from-version dropdown change handler
3. In the to-version dropdown change handler
4. In the apply button click handler

### Implementation Details

The fix was implemented with a script that:
1. Identified all instances of version variables declared with `const` but later modified
2. Replaced those declarations with `let` instead
3. Kept all other code logic intact

### Verification

The fix was verified by:
1. Confirming the absence of JavaScript errors in the console
2. Testing version selection in the diff modal
3. Verifying proper version comparison functionality

This fix resolves the last JavaScript runtime error in the diff viewer, allowing users to properly select and compare different versions of ontologies.


## 2025-04-26 - Fixed Version Selection in Ontology Diff Viewer

### Issue Fixed

Fixed the issue where the diff viewer would always compare version 11 to version 11, regardless of which versions were selected in the dropdown menus. Users were seeing:

```
Invalid Response Format
The server response did not contain the expected data format.
{}
```

### Root Cause Analysis

Multiple issues were contributing to the version selection problem:

1. **Missing Ontology ID**: The diff viewer didn't have access to the current ontology ID when making API requests
2. **Version Selection Issue**: Selected versions in dropdowns weren't being properly applied to API calls
3. **Parameter Validation**: Version numbers weren't being properly validated before use

### Comprehensive Solution

1. **Added Ontology ID Access**:
   - Added a hidden input field to store the current ontology ID: `<input type="hidden" id="currentOntologyId" value="{ ontology_id }">`
   - Modified JavaScript to access this value when building API URLs

2. **Fixed Version Selection Logic**:
   - Enhanced dropdown selection to use proper indexing instead of direct value assignment
   - Implemented proper selection of "to" version based on "from" version
   - Added validation to ensure correct version values are used

3. **Added Debugging Information**:
   - Added console logging of version selections and API parameters
   - Improved error handling to show detailed information about response data

### Implementation Details

This fix required changes to both the HTML template and JavaScript:

1. **HTML Template Updates**:
   - Added currentOntologyId hidden input to the diff modal
   - Ensured proper template variable for ontology_id was available

2. **JavaScript Fixes**:
   - Enhanced version dropdown selection logic
   - Added explicit version validation
   - Improved ontology ID detection with fallbacks
   - Added debugging information

### Verification

The fix was verified by:
1. Confirming version dropdowns work as expected
2. Testing different version selection combinations
3. Checking API requests have correct parameters
4. Verifying diff content loads properly

With these fixes in place, users can now properly compare any two versions of an ontology, making it much easier to track changes over time.


## 2025-04-26 - Fixed JavaScript Data Undefined Error in Diff Viewer

### Issue Fixed

Fixed the final bug in the diff viewer where accessing properties of undefined objects was causing errors:

```
Error loading diff: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'number')
```

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the data handling section of `loadDiff` function in `diff.js`, where properties were being accessed without checking if the parent objects existed:

```javascript
document.getElementById('diffFromInfo').innerText =
    `Version ${data.from_version.number} - ${formatDate(data.from_version.created_at)}`;
```

This would fail if `data` or `data.from_version` was undefined, which could happen if:
1. The server returned an unexpected response format
2. The API endpoint had an error but returned a 200 status
3. The data structure changed

### Solution

1. Added null/undefined checks before accessing nested properties:

```javascript
document.getElementById('diffFromInfo').innerText = 
    data && data.from_version ? 
    `Version ${data.from_version.number || 'N/A'} - ${formatDate(data.from_version.created_at || null)}` : 
    'Version information unavailable';
```

2. Added comprehensive data validation before processing:

```javascript
// Validate data structure
if (!data || !data.diff) {
    diffContent.innerHTML = `
        <div class="alert alert-danger">
            <h5>Invalid Response Format</h5>
            <p>The server response did not contain the expected data format.</p>
            <pre>${JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
        </div>
    `;
    return;
}
```

3. Added safe property access for all other data object uses:
   - Updated commit message handling
   - Added fallback values
   - Used optional chaining pattern

### Implementation Details

The fix uses defensive programming principles:
1. Never assume an object exists before accessing its properties
2. Always provide fallback values
3. Validate data early and show clear error messages
4. Show useful debugging information when possible

### Verification

The diff viewer now handles all edge cases gracefully:
1. Properly compares different versions
2. Shows useful error messages if data is missing
3. Doesn't throw uncaught exceptions
4. Provides debugging information for troubleshooting

This fix completes the series of improvements to the diff viewer, making it fully functional and robust.


## 2025-04-26 - Fixed JavaScript Fetch Chain Bug in Diff Viewer

### Issue Fixed

Fixed a critical bug in the diff viewer's fetch chain that was causing HTTP requests to fail when comparing versions. The error was:

```
Error loading diff: Error: Failed to load diff
```

### Root Cause Analysis

The bug was in the `loadDiff` function of `diff.js` where `response.json()` was being called twice in the Promise chain:

```javascript
fetch(url).then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(`HTTP error ${response.status}: ${response.statusText}` || "Failed to load diff");
    }
    return response.json();  // First call to response.json()
})
.then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error('Failed to load diff');
    }
    return response.json();  // Second call to response.json() - ERROR!
})
```

This caused the second `then()` handler to receive the already parsed JSON result from the first handler, not a Response object. Since the result doesn't have an `ok` property or a `json()` method, this caused the error.

### Solution

Removed the redundant second `then()` handler that was trying to process the Response object a second time:

```javascript
fetch(url).then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(`HTTP error ${response.status}: ${response.statusText}` || "Failed to load diff");
    }
    return response.json();  // Parse JSON only once
})
.then(data => {
    // Use the data directly
    // ...
})
```

### Implementation Details

1. Created a backup of the original JavaScript file
2. Identified the problematic fetch chain
3. Removed the redundant `then()` handler
4. Fixed the Promise chain to properly handle the parsed JSON response

### Verification

The fix was verified by:
1. Comparing different versions of the ontology
2. Checking the JavaScript console for errors
3. Verifying the diff content loads correctly

This fix resolves the final issue with the diff viewer, allowing users to properly compare any two versions of an ontology.

## 2025-04-26 - Comprehensive Fix for Ontology Version Diff Viewer System

### Complete List of Issues Fixed

1. **Python Syntax Errors in API Routes**
   - Fixed docstring syntax error in the diff API endpoint that prevented server startup
   - Fixed indentation mismatches between function definition and code blocks
   - Corrected nested try-except blocks in the API endpoint
   - Fixed missing `return api_bp` statement causing blueprint registration failure

2. **JavaScript Errors in Diff Viewer**
   - Fixed escaped single quotes in template literals causing syntax errors
   - Added missing document ready event listener to initialize compare buttons
   - Fixed implementation of version comparison buttons
   - Improved error handling for HTTP responses and edge cases

3. **Missing UI Components**
   - Restored "Compare" buttons on version items
   - Fixed button styling and event handlers
   - Added proper error display in the diff view

### Root Causes and Solutions

1. **API Blueprint Not Being Returned**
   Problem: The `create_api_routes` function was creating a Flask blueprint but not returning it, causing:
   ```
   AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'subdomain'
   ```
   Solution: Added proper `return api_bp` statement to ensure the blueprint object is returned to the main application.

2. **Syntax Error in Docstring**
   Problem: The docstring in the diff endpoint had improperly escaped triple quotes causing syntax errors.
   Solution: Rewrote the function with proper docstring formatting and consistent indentation.

3. **JavaScript Syntax Errors**
   Problem: Escaped single quotes in template literals were causing JavaScript execution to fail:
   ```
   diff.js:230 Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token
   ```
   Solution: Corrected the quote escaping in JavaScript string literals.

4. **Missing Compare Buttons**
   Problem: The addCompareButtonsToVersions function had implementation issues.
   Solution: Completely rewrote the function with proper button creation and event handling.

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Systematic Python Fixes**
   - Started with fixing the docstring syntax error
   - Fixed indentation issues in try-except blocks
   - Corrected function body structure
   - Added missing return statement for the blueprint

2. **JavaScript Error Handling**
   - Fixed escaped quotes in string literals
   - Improved HTTP response handling
   - Added proper error display
   - Implemented comprehensive button functioning

### Verification Steps

All fixes have been verified with:
1. Server startup without syntax errors
2. Proper blueprint registration
3. UI component rendering and functionality
4. Error handling for various edge cases

### Key Lessons

1. **Python-specific:**
   - Properly structure docstrings with triple quotes
   - Maintain consistent indentation in Python functions
   - Always return objects from factory functions in Flask
   - Close all try-except blocks properly

2. **JavaScript-specific:**
   - Properly handle quotes in template literals
   - Initialize UI components on document ready
   - Implement proper error handling for fetch operations
   - Add clear error messages for API failures

The ontology diff viewer is now fully functional with proper error handling and a complete user interface.


## 2025-04-26 - Fixed Missing Blueprint Return in API Routes

### Issue Fixed

Fixed a critical error in the ontology editor API routes where the `create_api_routes` function was not returning the blueprint object, causing:

```python
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'subdomain'
```

### Root Cause

The `create_api_routes` function in `ontology_editor/api/routes.py` was creating and configuring a Flask blueprint object (`api_bp`), but was missing the crucial `return api_bp` statement at the end of the function. 

When the main application tried to register the blueprint with `app.register_blueprint(ontology_editor_bp)`, it was actually receiving `None` instead of a valid Flask blueprint object, resulting in the attribute error.

### Solution Implementation

1. Added a proper `return api_bp` statement at the end of the `create_api_routes` function
2. Created the fix with a dedicated script that:
   - Identified the function boundary
   - Preserved existing code and indentation
   - Inserted the return statement with appropriate spacing
   - Made a backup of the original file before modification

### Verification

- Confirmed the server now starts without the blueprint registration error
- Verified the proper blueprint creation and return process
- Ran test script to ensure server startup success

### Key Lesson

This fix reinforces the importance of properly returning objects from factory functions when using a modular Flask application architecture. All blueprint factory functions must explicitly return the created blueprint object for successful registration with the main application.

1. **Python Syntax and Structure Errors Fixed**
   - Fixed multiple indentation and syntax issues in the diff endpoint
   - Completely rewrote the `get_versions_diff` function with proper structure
   - Corrected nested try-except blocks for proper error handling
   - Fixed missing import for difflib
   - Added handling for missing and invalid parameters

2. **JavaScript Error Handling Improvements**
   - Enhanced error handling with proper HTTP response status checking
   - Added client-side handling for same-version comparison
   - Improved error presentation with detailed error messages
   - Added footer close button event handler for modal

### Implementation Details

The implementation now correctly provides diff views between ontology versions with:
- Support for both unified (text) and split (side-by-side) diff formats
- Proper version metadata display including creation dates and commit messages
- Special handling for same-version comparison
- Comprehensive error messages with troubleshooting suggestions

### Key Fixes

1. **Backend API Syntax Issues**
   - Fixed broken docstring using proper triple quotes
   - Fixed unclosed try-except blocks in the API endpoint
   - Fixed indentation mismatches between function definition and code blocks
   - Added proper exception handling for all operations

2. **Server Stability**
   - Server now starts properly without syntax errors
   - Fixed potential orphaned try blocks that would cause runtime errors
   - Improved error reporting in logs for easier debugging

### Testing and Verification

The fixes have been tested with:
- Server startup verification
- Function-level syntax validation
- Manual code review for structure and consistency
- Line-by-line inspection of critical sections

### Final Implementation Strategy

Rather than attempting incremental fixes which were causing cascading issues, 
we completely rewrote the problematic function with the correct structure and formatting.
This approach ensured:
1. A clean implementation without legacy syntax issues
2. Proper nesting of control structures and exception handling
3. Consistent code style and indentation
4. Complete preservation of the intended functionality

The server now starts without errors and the diff viewer functions properly with enhanced error handling.

### Technical Takeaways

1. When dealing with complex syntax issues, especially in Python where indentation is critical:
   - Consider a complete rewrite rather than incremental fixes
   - Maintain consistent indentation throughout function bodies
   - Ensure try-except blocks are properly closed
   - Pay special attention to nested blocks and their indentation

2. When implementing API endpoints:
   - Always include comprehensive error handling
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Return appropriate HTTP status codes
   - Provide helpful error messages

### Syntax Issues Fixed

1. **Python Syntax Errors and Indentation Issues**
   - Fixed the docstring syntax error in routes.py that prevented server startup
   - Corrected docstring indentation to be properly indented within the function
   - Fixed try block indentation to align with the docstring
   - Fixed the entire function body indentation for consistency
   - Corrected route definition indentation to match the rest of the code

2. **JavaScript Error Handling Improvements**
   - Enhanced error handling with proper HTTP status checking
   - Added client-side handling for same-version comparisons
   - Fixed the footer close button event handler
   - Improved error message display with troubleshooting suggestions

### Fix Implementation Strategy

1. **Multi-step targeted approach:**
   - Created `scripts/manual_docstring_fix.py` to fix docstring syntax error
   - Created `scripts/fix_docstring_indentation.py` to properly indent the docstring
   - Created `scripts/fix_function_block.py` to align the try block and function body
   - Created `scripts/fix_route_indentation.py` to properly indent route decorators
   - Created incremental fixes to ensure each step solved one specific issue

2. **Frontend enhancements:**
   - Created `scripts/update_diff_viewer_fix.py` to improve error handling
   - Created `scripts/update_footer_close_handler.py` to add missing button handler
   - Used client-side handling to improve user experience for same-version comparisons

### Debugging Techniques Used

1. **Line-by-line analysis approach**
   - Examined each part of the problematic function in isolation
   - Used precise line number targeting for fixes
   - Created verification scripts to check if issues were resolved
   - Fixed indentation issues level by level (route decorator, function def, docstring, function body)

2. **Direct syntax fixing instead of regex replacements**
   - Used direct line replacement to avoid regex issues
   - Made explicit indentation adjustments with exact space counts
   - Created backups before each fix for easy rollback
   - Maintained consistent indentation throughout the function

### Key Lessons

1. Python is highly sensitive to indentation, especially in:
   - Function definitions and docstrings
   - Blocks of code like try/except statements
   - Nested control structures

2. When fixing indentation issues:
   - Work systematically from the outermost level inward
   - Fix one level of indentation at a time
   - Ensure docstrings are properly indented (4 spaces deeper than function def)
   - Maintain consistent indentation for function bodies (8 spaces)

### Verification Process

1. Each fix was verified by:
   - Checking the specific line after change
   - Looking at several surrounding lines for consistency
   - Running syntax checks on the modified file
   - Finally testing the server startup to confirm the fix worked

The server now starts successfully and the diff viewer loads properly, with enhanced error handling and a better user experience.
