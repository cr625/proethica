## 2025-04-28 - Fixed MCP Server Port Conflict Issue

### Issue Fixed

Fixed an issue where the ProEthica application failed to start with an `OSError: [Errno 98] address already in use` error on port 5001. This prevented the MCP server from starting properly.

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue occurred because:
1. Multiple scripts were attempting to start different variants of the MCP server
2. The process termination in the restart script was insufficient (only killing specific process patterns)
3. No port availability check was performed before starting the new server
4. Multiple server variants (enhanced_mcp_server.py and http_ontology_mcp_server.py) could run simultaneously on the same port

### Solution Implemented

1. **Enhanced MCP Server Restart Script**
   - Added comprehensive process cleanup for all MCP server variants
   - Implemented port availability checking before starting the server
   - Added lock file mechanism to prevent multiple instances
   - Improved logging and error reporting
   - Added verification that the server is properly listening on the port

2. **Key Improvements**
   - More robust process detection and termination
   - Multiple detection methods (ps, pkill, lsof, netstat)
   - Explicit verification of port availability
   - Better error messages with troubleshooting guidance
   - Enhanced logging to a dedicated log file

### Benefits

- **More Reliable Startup**: Application startup is now more robust
- **Better Error Handling**: Clear error messages help with troubleshooting
- **Improved Logging**: Comprehensive logs make issue diagnosis easier
- **Process Management**: Better management of MCP server processes
- **Port Conflict Resolution**: Automatic detection and handling of port conflicts

This fix ensures the ProEthica application can start reliably without port conflicts from previously running MCP server instances.

## 2025-04-28 - Enhanced Ontology-LLM Integration via MCP

### Actions Taken

1. **Fixed Ontology Agent Integration**
   - Fixed compatibility issue between agent module and Enhanced MCP Client
   - Added `get_entities` method to EnhancedMCPClient class as an alias for `get_world_entities`
   - Implemented robust error handling and mock data fallback in the client
   - Enhanced the client to handle API failures gracefully with appropriate fallback data

2. **Created Comprehensive MCP Integration Documentation**
   - Added detailed documentation in `docs/enhanced_ontology_llm_integration.md`
   - Documented three-layer architecture (Ontology, MCP, LLM layers)
   - Detailed all available methods for ontology access through MCP
   - Created implementation examples for context injection and tool-based access

3. **Added Robust Fallback Mechanisms**
   - Implemented mock data generation for testing and error recovery
   - Added graceful error handling that preserves user experience
   - Created standardized data formatting for LLM consumption
   - Enhanced debugging capabilities with detailed error reporting

### Key Components

1. **Enhanced MCP Client**
   - Provides a high-level interface for LLM-ontology interaction
