## Phase 2.4 Progress: Document Storage for Structure Triples

We've implemented the following enhancements to the document storage system:

1. Created a `DocumentSection` model with pgvector support for efficient section-based similarity searches
2. Created migration scripts to set up the database table and add the pgvector extension
3. Enhanced the `SectionEmbeddingService` to store section embeddings in the new table
4. Added section-level similarity search functionality

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Extensions

- Added pgvector extension to PostgreSQL for vector similarity operations
- Created a `document_sections` table with the following structure:
  - `id`: Primary key
  - `document_id`: Foreign key to documents table
  - `section_id`: Section identifier (e.g., 'facts', 'discussion')
  - `section_type`: Type of section (for categorization)
  - `content`: The section text content
  - `embedding`: Vector representation for similarity searches (pgvector type)
  - `section_metadata`: JSON metadata for the section

### Key Components

1. **DocumentSection Model**: 
   - Maps to the `document_sections` table
   - Provides ORM access to section data and embeddings

2. **SectionEmbeddingService**: 
   - Extends the EmbeddingService to handle section-level embeddings
   - Provides methods to generate, store, and query section embeddings

3. **Migration Scripts**:
   - `migration_document_sections.py`: Creates the pgvector extension and document_sections table
   - `migrate_section_data.py`: Migrates existing section data from document metadata to the new table

### Current Issues

1. **Embedding Format Compatibility**: We're facing an issue with pgvector where it expects embeddings in a specific format that differs from how we're currently storing them.
   Error: "operator does not exist: vector <=> numeric[]" indicates incompatibility with pgvector's expected data type.

2. **Transaction Handling**: Some SQL transaction issues are occurring during similarity searches.

3. **Flask App Context**: The migration script needs better handling of the Flask app context to avoid SQLAlchemy instance errors.

## Next Steps

1. Fix the pgvector compatibility issues:
   - Research proper PostgreSQL pgvector type handling
   - Update both storage and query methods to match pgvector's expected format

2. Improve transaction handling:
   - Implement better error handling and transaction rollback
   - Ensure tests properly clean up after themselves

3. Enhance the section embedding services:
   - Complete the section-based search functionality
   - Add new API endpoints for section-level similarity searches

4. Update the UI to display section-level structure and enable section-level searches

## Phase 3 Planning: Section-Level Embeddings

Once the current issues are resolved, we'll be ready to move on to Phase 3:

1. Enhance the EmbeddingService for section-level embeddings
2. Create search and comparison functions for section-to-section similarity
3. Develop visualization components for section relationships
4. Implement UI elements for section-based similarity searches

## Implementation Timeline

- **Phase 2.4**: Storage schema updates - In progress
- **Phase 3.0**: Section-level embeddings - Next milestone
- **Phase 3.1**: Section similarity functions - Pending
- **Phase 4.0**: UI enhancements - Future work
