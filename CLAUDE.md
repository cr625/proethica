### Updated ontology storage to use database-only system

- Created system for migrating ontologies from files to database storage
- Added patch to MCP server to prioritize database ontology loading with fallback to files
- Created scripts for the migration process:
  - `scripts/archive_ontology_files.py`: Archives original TTL files before replacement
  - `scripts/update_ontology_mcp_server.py`: Patches MCP server to load from database
  - `scripts/remove_ontology_files.py`: Replaces TTL files with placeholders
  - `scripts/setup_ontology_db_only.sh`: Combined script for the complete migration process
- Added comprehensive documentation in `docs/ontology_file_migration_guide.md`
- Added documentation explaining repository branch management in `docs/repo_branches.md`
- Main benefits:
  - Eliminates inconsistencies between file and database versions
  - Enables proper version tracking through the database
  - Maintains compatibility with existing code through fallback mechanisms
  - Original files archived for reference if needed

### Next Steps:
- Implement visualization of ontologies in a hierarchy view
- Update ontology editor to show relationships between ontologies
