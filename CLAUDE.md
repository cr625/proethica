## May 14, 2025: Concept Extraction Feature Fix

### Task Completed
Fixed the guideline concept extraction functionality to ensure concepts are displayed when the "Analyze Concepts" button is clicked.

### Changes Made
1. Fixed the incomplete `generate_triples` method in `GuidelineAnalysisService` class:
   - Completed the method implementation that was previously truncated
   - Ensured proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
   - Added proper type handling for different concept types (roles, principles, obligations)

2. Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/concept_extraction_implementation.md` that outlines:
   - Background of the feature
   - Existing architecture
   - Implementation plan
   - Technical details about the concept extraction process
   - Troubleshooting steps
   - Testing process
   - Future improvements

### How to Test
1. Navigate to a guideline page
2. Click the "Analyze Concepts" button
3. Verify that concepts are extracted and displayed in the concept review page
4. Select some concepts and save them
5. Verify that the selected concepts appear on the guideline page

### Current Architecture
The concept extraction process involves several components:

1. **UI Components**:
   - `guideline_content.html` - Contains the "Analyze Concepts" button
   - `guideline_extracted_concepts.html` - Displays the extracted concepts for review

2. **Routes**:
   - `worlds_extract_only.py` - Contains routes for extracting concepts directly
   - `worlds_direct_concepts.py` - Provides direct concept extraction implementation
   - `fix_concept_extraction.py` - Ensures concept extraction works even when LLM is unavailable

3. **Services**:
   - `GuidelineAnalysisService` - Handles the extraction and processing of concepts

### Flow
1. User clicks "Analyze Concepts" on a guideline page
2. The route handler calls `GuidelineAnalysisService.extract_concepts()`
3. Concepts are extracted (first trying MCP server, then falling back to direct LLM if needed)
4. The extracted concepts are displayed in the concept review page
5. User selects which concepts to save
6. Selected concepts are processed and saved for the guideline

### Notes
- The fixed implementation preserves the original architecture and API contracts
- The system will now properly handle concept extraction even when the MCP server or LLM is unavailable
- The feature now works consistently across the application
