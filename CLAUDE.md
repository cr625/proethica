## May 14, 2025: VSCode Debugging Environment Fix

### Task Completed
Fixed a Python module import issue that was preventing the VSCode debugger from properly running the application.

### Problem
When running the application in VSCode debug mode, there was a module not found error for the `markdown` package. This occurred because the VSCode debugger was using the conda Python environment (`/opt/conda/bin/python`), but the application's dependencies were installed in the user's site-packages directory (`/home/codespace/.local/lib/python3.12/site-packages`).

### Changes Made
1. Installed the `markdown` package using conda to make it available in the conda environment
2. Updated the VSCode debug configuration in `.vscode/launch.json` to add the user's site-packages to the Python path:
   ```json
   "env": {
     "PYTHONPATH": "/home/codespace/.local/lib/python3.12/site-packages:${PYTHONPATH}",
     "USE_CONDA": "false"
   }
   ```
3. Created a script `scripts/ensure_python_path.sh` that properly sets up the Python environment for debugging
4. Modified `scripts/setup_debug_environment.sh` to source the Python path setup script

### How to Use
The VSCode debugger should now work properly with the following steps:
1. In VSCode, go to the Run and Debug panel (Ctrl+Shift+D)
2. Select "Debug ProEthica Application" from the dropdown menu
3. Click the green "Play" button
4. The setup script will run first, configure the Python environment, then the application will start with the debugger attached

### Additional Notes
This fix ensures that the debugger can access all packages installed in the user's site-packages directory while running in the conda Python environment. It should work for all Python dependencies regardless of where they are installed.

## May 14, 2025: Missing Python Package Fix

### Task Completed
Fixed a missing Python package dependency issue where the `markdown` package was required but not explicitly listed in the requirements file.

### Changes Made
1. Installed the `markdown` package using conda: `conda install markdown -y`
2. Updated `requirements.txt` to include the markdown package in the DOCUMENT PROCESSING section
3. Verified that the package is properly documented as a dependency

### How to Use
The `markdown` package is used by template filters for converting markdown content to HTML in the web application. It should now be automatically installed when setting up the environment using the requirements file.

## May 14, 2025: VSCode Debugging Configuration

### Task Completed
Created a custom VSCode debugging configuration that allows debugging the ProEthica application which is normally started using the `start_proethica_updated.sh` shell script.

### Changes Made
1. Created a setup script `scripts/setup_debug_environment.sh`:
   - Handles all environment setup tasks from `start_proethica_updated.sh`
   - Configures environment variables
   - Starts the MCP server
   - Initializes the database
   - But does not start the Flask application (this is handled by the debugger)

2. Created VSCode configurations:
   - Updated `.vscode/launch.json` with a new debug configuration that runs `run.py`
   - Created `.vscode/tasks.json` to define the pre-launch task that runs the setup script
   - These configurations work together to first set up the environment, then start the application with the debugger attached

3. Added documentation in `docs/vscode_debugging_setup.md`:
   - Explains how to use the debugger with ProEthica
   - Describes the configuration files and their purpose
   - Provides troubleshooting tips

### How to Use
1. In VSCode, go to the Run and Debug panel (Ctrl+Shift+D)
2. Select "Debug ProEthica Application" from the dropdown menu
3. Click the green "Play" button
4. The setup script will run first, then the application will start with the debugger attached

### Notes
- This approach separates the environment setup from the application launch, allowing the debugger to attach to the application at startup
- The setup script preserves all the functionality of the original `start_proethica_updated.sh` script
- Breakpoints can be set in the code and will be hit during execution

## May 14, 2025: Flask Blueprint URL Routing Reference

### Important Note on URL Routing with Blueprints

When using Flask blueprints, URL endpoints must be referenced with the blueprint name prefix:

**Correct format for blueprint routes:**
```python
url_for('blueprint_name.route_name')  # Example: url_for('index.index')
```

**Incorrect format (causes BuildError):**
```python
url_for('route_name')  # Example: url_for('index') - This will fail!
```

Common errors that occur when this pattern is not followed:
```
werkzeug.routing.exceptions.BuildError: Could not build url for endpoint 'main.index'. Did you mean 'index.index' instead?
```

Most common incorrectly referenced endpoints that need to be updated:
- `main.index` → `index.index`
- `index` → `index.index`

This applies to:
- Templates using `url_for()`
- Python code using `redirect(url_for())`
- Any other use of `url_for()`

Always check template files first when encountering URL routing errors after blueprint refactoring.

## May 14, 2025: Concept Extraction Feature Fix

### Task Completed
Fixed the guideline concept extraction functionality to ensure concepts are displayed when the "Analyze Concepts" button is clicked.

### Changes Made
1. Fixed the incomplete `generate_triples` method in `GuidelineAnalysisService` class:
   - Completed the method implementation that was previously truncated
   - Ensured proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
   - Added proper type handling for different concept types (roles, principles, obligations)

2. Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/concept_extraction_implementation.md` that outlines:
   - Background of the feature
   - Existing architecture
   - Implementation plan
   - Technical details about the concept extraction process
   - Troubleshooting steps
   - Testing process
   - Future improvements

### How to Test
1. Navigate to a guideline page
2. Click the "Analyze Concepts" button
3. Verify that concepts are extracted and displayed in the concept review page
4. Select some concepts and save them
5. Verify that the selected concepts appear on the guideline page

### Current Architecture
The concept extraction process involves several components:

1. **UI Components**:
   - `guideline_content.html` - Contains the "Analyze Concepts" button
   - `guideline_extracted_concepts.html` - Displays the extracted concepts for review

2. **Routes**:
   - `worlds_extract_only.py` - Contains routes for extracting concepts directly
   - `worlds_direct_concepts.py` - Provides direct concept extraction implementation
   - `fix_concept_extraction.py` - Ensures concept extraction works even when LLM is unavailable

3. **Services**:
   - `GuidelineAnalysisService` - Handles the extraction and processing of concepts

### Flow
1. User clicks "Analyze Concepts" on a guideline page
2. The route handler calls `GuidelineAnalysisService.extract_concepts()`
3. Concepts are extracted (first trying MCP server, then falling back to direct LLM if needed)
4. The extracted concepts are displayed in the concept review page
5. User selects which concepts to save
6. Selected concepts are processed and saved for the guideline

### Notes
- The fixed implementation preserves the original architecture and API contracts
- The system will now properly handle concept extraction even when the MCP server or LLM is unavailable
- The feature now works consistently across the application

## May 14, 2025: LLM Connection Improvements and Model Updates

### Task Completed
Enhanced the LLM connection functionality and implemented robust fallback mechanisms for concept extraction to ensure the feature works even when LLM services are unavailable.

### Changes Made
1. Created a standalone test script (`test_llm_connection.py`):
   - Script tests LLM connectivity outside the Flask application context
   - Provides detailed logging of connection attempts and issues
   - Tests both simple completions and concept extraction with sample guidelines
   - Helps diagnose LLM connection issues independently

2. Enhanced fallback mechanism in `GuidelineAnalysisService`:
   - Improved fallback logic to clearly indicate when mock concepts are being used
   - Added better error reporting with specific error messages
   - Ensured mock concepts are generated even when all LLM connections fail

3. Updated LLM model references:
   - Changed from `claude-3-opus-20240229` to `claude-3-7-sonnet-latest` or `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`
   - Updated all API calls to use the new models
   - Maintained compatibility with different Anthropic SDK versions

4. Documented concept extraction implementation:
   - Added detailed explanation of the concept extraction process
   - Included testing procedures and troubleshooting steps
   - Outlined future improvements for the feature

### How to Test LLM Connection
1. Set the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable:
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

2. Run the test script:
   ```bash
   python test_llm_connection.py
   ```

3. Check the output for connection status, successful completions, and concept extraction results

### Notes
- The system now gracefully degrades when LLM is unavailable by providing mock concepts
- The test script helps isolate LLM connection issues from application logic problems
- Model updates ensure the application uses the latest available Claude models
- Even without a valid API key, the concept extraction feature will work with generated mock concepts

## May 14, 2025: Guidelines Documentation Consolidation

### Task Completed
Consolidated all guideline-related documentation into two comprehensive files for improved organization and clarity.

### Changes Made
1. Created `docs/guidelines_implementation_progress.md`:
   - Comprehensive document detailing the current implementation status
   - Includes architecture description, implementation details, and recent achievements
   - Documents the technical approach and code examples of key implementation aspects

2. Created `docs/guidelines_implementation_next_steps.md`:
   - Roadmap for future guidelines feature development
   - Organized into immediate priorities and future enhancements
   - Includes technical implementation plans and success criteria

3. Archived redundant guideline documentation:
   - Moved `README_GUIDELINES_TESTING.md` to `docs/archive/`
   - Moved `README_GUIDELINE_MCP_INTEGRATION.md` to `docs/archive/`
   - Moved `RUN_WEBAPP_WITH_GUIDELINES.md` to `docs/archive/`
   - Moved `testing_guidelines_feature.md` to `docs/archive/`
   - Moved `CODESPACE_GUIDELINES_STARTUP.md` to `docs/archive/`
   - Moved `docs/multiple_guidelines.md` to `docs/archive/`
   - Consolidated information from all these files into the progress and next steps files

### How to Use
The new documentation structure provides:
- `guidelines_implementation_progress.md` - Reference for current state and implementation details
- `guidelines_implementation_next_steps.md` - Planning document for ongoing development efforts

### Notes
- All important information from previous documentation has been preserved in the archive folder
- The new structure reduces duplication and makes it easier to find relevant information
- Future guideline feature development should update these two files rather than creating additional ones
- Runtime environment information, testing procedures, and MCP integration details have been documented in both files
