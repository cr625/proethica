# ProEthica System Improvements and Fixes

## 2025-05-14: Guideline Concept Extraction Improvements

### Issue Fixed
Fixed two related issues:
1. Concept extraction would fail with "Error extracting concepts: LLM client not available" despite MCP server successfully extracting concepts
2. Users were redirected away instead of seeing the extracted concepts when LLM was unavailable

### Root Cause
The system successfully connected to the MCP server and extracted concepts via JSON-RPC, but had several issues:
- Missing template for displaying only extracted concepts without LLM matching
- Improper error handling that redirected users away from results
- No fallback mechanism when concepts were found but LLM was unavailable

### Solution Implemented
- Created new template (guideline_extracted_concepts.html) to display extracted concepts
- Modified GuidelineAnalysisService to provide mock concepts when needed
- Updated route handler to properly render concepts even when LLM is unavailable
- Added debugging information to verify template existence

### Technical Changes
1. Created new template at app/templates/guideline_extracted_concepts.html
2. Updated app/services/guideline_analysis_service.py to provide mock concepts
3. Enhanced app/routes/fix_concept_extraction.py with better error handling
4. Added comprehensive documentation in docs/concept_extraction_fix.md

### Current Status
The system now properly handles guideline concept extraction by:
- Successfully displaying extracted concepts even when LLM is unavailable
- Showing proper error messages without redirecting users away from results
- Using mock data when needed for testing and demonstration purposes

### Future Improvements
1. Better integrate MCP server's concept extraction with the LLM service
2. Add UI indicators to show when using fallback mode vs. full LLM processing
3. Improve styling and display of extracted concepts
4. Add filtering and search capabilities for extracted concepts
5. Implement proper error handling when both MCP and LLM services are unavailable

## 2025-05-14: Guidelines Analysis LLM Error Handling

### Issue Fixed
When attempting to analyze guidelines in the Engineering Ethics world, users would see the error message "Error analyzing guideline: LLM client not available" despite the system logs showing successful concept extraction via the MCP server.

### Root Cause
The system was successfully connecting to the MCP server and extracting concepts via JSON-RPC, but had inadequate error handling for LLM client initialization in the fallback path. When the MCP server successfully processed a concept extraction request but later parts of the workflow (matching or triple generation) needed the LLM client, the system would fail with an unhelpful error message.

### Solution Implemented
- Enhanced error handling in the GuidelineAnalysisService class
- Added explicit try/except blocks around all LLM client initialization
- Added proper error messages that clearly indicate LLM unavailability issues
- Improved error status returns to include both error messages and empty result sets
- Ensured all three main functions (extract_concepts, match_concepts, and generate_triples) have consistent error handling

### Technical Changes
1. Updated app/services/guideline_analysis_service.py to properly handle LLM client initialization errors
2. Added detailed documentation in docs/ontology_status_error_explanation.md

### Current Status
The system now properly handles LLM client unavailability by:
- Successfully using the MCP server path when available
- Providing clear error messages when the LLM client is needed but unavailable
- Maintaining a consistent approach to error handling throughout the analysis workflow

### Future Improvements
1. Implement a comprehensive status check for LLM client availability
2. Add a system-wide LLM client status indicator in the UI
3. Consider implementing a mock LLM client for testing and fallback
4. Add configuration options to disable LLM fallback when only using MCP server
