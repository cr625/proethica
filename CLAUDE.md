# ProEthica Development Progress

## Collapsible Conversation History Panel (2025-04-12)

### Completed Tasks:

1. **Modular History Panel Implementation**:
   - Created a separate history panel template in `app/agent_module/templates/history_panel.html`
   - Integrated the panel into the main agent window using template inclusion
   - Improved organizational structure by maintaining module separation

2. **Collapsible Functionality**:
   - Added toggle button to expand/collapse the history panel
   - Implemented smooth transition animation with CSS
   - Dynamically resized columns when collapsed (history: col-md-3 → col-md-1, agent: col-md-6 → col-md-8)
   - Created compact collapsed view showing only essential controls
   - Added user preference persistence using localStorage

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensured proper layout at different screen sizes
   - Maintained usability in both collapsed and expanded states

### Current Status:
The conversation history panel can now be minimized to provide more space for the agent conversation window, allowing users to focus on their current interaction while still having quick access to history when needed.

### Next Steps To Consider:

1. **Enhanced User Experience**:
   - Add keyboard shortcuts for toggling panel state
   - Implement hover reveal functionality for collapsed panel
   - Add animations for panel content to improve visual feedback

2. **Additional Panel Improvements**:
   - Add conversation filtering options directly in the panel
   - Implement search functionality in collapsed view
   - Add conversation tagging capabilities

## Authentication Implementation for Agent Routes (2025-04-11)

### Completed Tasks:

1. **Modular Architecture Implemented**:
   - Created a complete set of interfaces in `app/agent_module/interfaces/base.py`
   - Developed conversation models in `app/agent_module/models/conversation.py`
   - Built authentication services in `app/agent_module/services/auth.py`
   - Implemented session management in `app/agent_module/services/session.py`
   - Created ProEthica-specific adapters in `app/agent_module/adapters/proethica.py`
   - Implemented blueprint factory in `app/agent_module/blueprints/agent.py`
   - Added package initialization with convenience functions in `app/agent_module/__init__.py`

2. **Authentication Features**:
   - Integrated with Flask-Login for secured routes
   - Added configurable authentication requiring login for all agent routes
   - Implemented option to disable authentication for development/testing
   - Created test suite with mocked components in `tests/test_agent_module.py`
   - Added documentation in `app/agent_module/README.md`

3. **Tests and Verification**:
   - Unit tests confirm that authentication is enforced when enabled
   - Tests verify that authentication can be disabled for specific scenarios
   - Manual testing confirmed redirects to login page when unauthenticated
   - Server logs verified proper 302 redirects for protected routes

### Current Status:
The agent module is integrated into the main application and working correctly. All routes under `/agent/` now require authentication by default. The implementation is modular and follows clean design principles.

### Next Steps To Consider:

1. **Enhanced Authentication Options**:
   - Add role-based access control (RBAC) for agent routes
   - Implement API token-based authentication for programmatic access
   - Add authentication audit logging for security monitoring

2. **UI Improvements**:
   - Create login/logout directly within the agent UI
   - Add user profile and settings within agent interface
   - Implement customized error pages for authentication failures

3. **Advanced Features**:
   - Add multi-factor authentication support
   - Implement session timeout and automatic logout
   - Add IP-based access restrictions for sensitive agent operations

4. **Documentation Enhancements**:
   - Create visual guide for authentication workflow
   - Add swagger/OpenAPI documentation for API endpoints
   - Create developer guide for extending authentication system

5. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Add caching for authenticated sessions
   - Optimize database queries in auth adapters
   - Implement connection pooling for auth providers

## Next Project To Consider:

Based on the current state of the application, these might be good features to implement next:

1. **Agent Personalization**: Allow users to customize their agent experience
2. **Export/Import Capabilities**: Enable sharing of agent conversations 
3. **Batch Processing**: Add ability to run agent against multiple inputs
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Track agent performance and usage patterns
5. **Integration with External Systems**: Add connectors to common enterprise systems
