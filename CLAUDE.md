# ProEthica and REALM Development Log

## May 11, 2025 - Database Schema Initialization and Error Resolution

### Issue Resolved: Database Table Creation

**Problem:** ProEthica was encountering database errors when accessing routes like `/scenarios/` and `/worlds/`. The error logs showed that the database tables like `scenarios` and `worlds` did not exist.

**Solution:**
1. Created a database initialization script (`scripts/initialize_proethica_db.py`) that:
   - Sets up the proper database connection
   - Creates all necessary database tables for the application
   - Verifies the tables have been created correctly
   
2. Updated the startup script (`start_proethica_updated.sh`) to:
   - Run the database initialization script during startup
   - Improve error handling for the database connection string
   - Properly clean up and restart MCP server processes

**Results:**
- The routes `/scenarios/`, `/worlds/`, and `/cases/` now work correctly
- The database tables are properly created
- The MCP server starts up correctly and is accessible

**Technical Notes:**
- The database URI was being incorrectly parsed due to escaped characters in earlier implementation
- Setting the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable directly in the initialization script fixed this issue
- The database schema is now initialized before the application starts

## REALM Project Overview and Integration Plan

### REALM - Materials Science Ontology Integration

REALM (Resource for Engineering and Advanced Learning in Materials) is a new application being developed to integrate with the Materials Science and Engineering Ontology (MSEO) from [matportal.org/ontologies/MSEO](https://matportal.org/ontologies/MSEO).

**Current Components:**
- Created directory structure for REALM application
- Implemented MCP server integration for MSEO ontology
- Set up shared database infrastructure with ProEthica

**Integration Strategy:**
- REALM will use shared components from the agent_module
- The ontology MCP server will be extended for both applications
- Common database infrastructure will be used but with separate schemas

**Next Steps:**
1. Complete the MSEO ontology integration with the MCP server
2. Implement the REALM-specific UI components
3. Extend the ontology editor for materials science concepts

## May 11, 2025 - Ontology Enhancement Branch Creation

### Unified Ontology Server Development

Created a new branch `ontology-enhancement` from `realm-integration` to focus on enhancing the ontology functionality in ProEthica, particularly for engineering ethics applications.

**Objectives:**
- Consolidate multiple MCP server implementations into a unified server
- Restore engineering ethics ontology from the backup
- Integrate temporal functionality directly into the server
- Enhance case analysis using ontology entities
- Improve LLM integration with ontology data

**Technical Approach:**
1. Unified modular architecture for MCP server components
2. Database restoration of engineering ontology from backup file
3. Case entity extraction and analysis enhancements
4. Agent module updates for better ontology interactions

**Implementation Plan:**
- Created implementation documentation in `docs/ontology_enhancement_plan.md`
- Will develop modular architecture with pluggable components
- Focus will be on engineering ethics ontology with improved case analysis

This enhancement will restore focus on engineering ethics after the REALM integration branch work, which had shifted the focus to materials science ontology.

## May 11, 2025 - Ontology Case Analysis Implementation Planning

### McLaren-based Case Analysis Planning

Developed a comprehensive implementation plan for the ontology-based case analysis system, using McLaren's methodology for engineering ethics case analysis.

**Key Components of the Plan:**

1. **Case Analysis Framework**:
   - Implementation of McLaren's operationalization techniques from McLaren_2003.pdf
   - Focus on extensional definitions of ethical principles
   - Integration with the unified ontology server
   
2. **Temporal Case Representation**:
   - Conversion of cases into temporal representations for simulation
   - Implementation of a timeline view for ethical decision points
   - Support for scenario creation from existing cases
   
3. **Pattern Matching and Prediction**:
   - Simple pattern matching between cases based on overlapping ontology elements
   - Outcome prediction based on similar cases
   - Confidence visualization for predictions

**Phased Implementation Approach:**
1. First phase: Verification and basic setup of ProEthica with unified ontology server
2. Second phase: Implementation of case analysis framework and entity extraction
3. Third phase: Case transformation to scenarios with temporal representations
4. Fourth phase: Pattern matching, prediction, and final UI integration

**Documentation:**
- Created `docs/ontology_case_analysis_plan.md` with detailed implementation plan
- The plan follows McLaren's approach to operationalization in engineering ethics

**Next Steps:**
- Begin Phase 1 by verifying the Flask application functionality
- Set up database schema for enhanced ontology entity tracking
- Develop initial case analysis components
