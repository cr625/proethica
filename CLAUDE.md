# ProEthica Development Log

This file tracks progress, decisions, and important changes to the ProEthica system.

## 2025-04-25 - Fixed Ontology Entity Extraction and Display

### Changes Made:
- Created a new service `OntologyEntityService` that directly extracts entities from ontologies stored in the database 
- Modified the world detail view to use the new service instead of the MCP server for entity extraction
- Implemented entity extraction functions that properly handle different namespaces and entity types
- Added caching to improve performance when retrieving the same ontology multiple times

### Technical Details:
- The new service parses the ontology content with RDFLib and extracts entities of different types
- It handles both domain-specific namespaces and the intermediate namespace
- It properly identifies entity instances that have both `EntityType` and specific type declarations
- The world details page now displays all entities correctly

### Benefits:
- More reliable entity extraction independent of MCP server issues
- Simplified code path with direct database access instead of HTTP calls
- Better error handling and logging for ontology parsing issues
- Performance improvements through caching

### Next Steps:
- Continue testing with different ontologies to ensure all entity types are properly extracted
- Consider adding more detailed error messages for ontology syntax validation
- Review the ontology editor to ensure it produces valid syntax for entity definitions

### Updated ontology storage to use database-only system

- Created system for migrating ontologies from files to database storage
- Added patch to MCP server to prioritize database ontology loading with fallback to files
- Created scripts for the migration process:
  - `scripts/archive_ontology_files.py`: Archives original TTL files before replacement
  - `scripts/update_ontology_mcp_server.py`: Patches MCP server to load from database
  - `scripts/remove_ontology_files.py`: Replaces TTL files with placeholders
  - `scripts/setup_ontology_db_only.sh`: Combined script for the complete migration process
- Main benefits:
  - Eliminates inconsistencies between file and database versions
  - Enables proper version tracking through the database
  - Maintains compatibility with existing code through fallback mechanisms
  - Original files archived for reference if needed
