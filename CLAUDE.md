## May 11, 2025: Improving Triple Handling in NSPE Case Pipeline

Created an improved implementation of the NSPE case pipeline that addresses issues with incomplete triples and improves triple display in the case detail view. These changes enable proper representation of both McLaren extensional definition triples and engineering ethics ontology triples.

### Implementation Highlights:

1. **Fixed McLaren Extensional Definition Module**:
   - Implemented `validate_triple()` function to ensure all triples have proper subject-predicate-object format
   - Improved URI construction for triple subjects, predicates, and objects
   - Added metadata to triples for better front-end display and categorization
   - Enhanced the `add_mclaren_extensional_triples()` function to create complete triples

2. **Enhanced Engineering World Integration**:
   - Updated `create_engineering_world_triples()` to use consistent document URI patterns
   - Added triple metadata for categorization and display
   - Created proper semantic connections between cases and engineering ethics concepts

3. **UI Improvements for Triple Display**:
   - Added color coding to the case detail page to distinguish between McLaren extensional triples (green) and engineering ethics triples (blue)
   - Improved triple label display to show cleaner, more user-friendly triple information
   - Added legend for triple color coding

4. **Pipeline Workflow**:
   - Created scripts for removing and re-importing cases with the improved triple handling:
     - `delete_case_187.py`: Safely removes the test case and all associated triples
     - `import_improved_case_187.py`: Re-imports the case with proper triple handling

### Key Improvements:

- **Complete Triples**: All triples now have proper subject-predicate-object structure
- **Visual Distinction**: Users can easily distinguish between McLaren extensional and engineering ethics triples
- **Proper URIs**: Consistent URI patterns for subjects, predicates, and objects
- **Enhanced Metadata**: Triple metadata enables better categorization and display
- **Validation**: Triple validation prevents incomplete or malformed triples

### Applied Concepts to Case 187:

Engineering Ethics Concepts added:
- **Roles**: Structural Engineer Role, Consulting Engineer Role
- **Actions**: Design Action, Review Action, Report Action
- **Conditions**: Structural Deficiency, Safety Hazard
- **Dilemmas**: Professional Responsibility Dilemma, Engineering Ethical Dilemma
- **Principles**: Honesty Principle, Disclosure Principle, Public Safety Principle

McLaren Extensional Definition concepts:
- PrincipleInstantiation connections to HonestDisclosure
- Proper linking between instantiations, principles, and techniques

### Next Steps:

1. **Testing**: Continue testing with additional NSPE cases to verify the improvements
2. **Documentation**: Update project documentation to reflect the improved triple handling approach
3. **Automation**: Enhance automatic identification of engineering ethics concepts through improved NLP approaches
