## 2025-05-17: Enabling Live LLM Integration for Guideline Concept Extraction

### Completed Changes

1. Fixed Anthropic API call issues in guideline concept extraction:
   - Modified `guideline_analysis_module.py` to use the correct Anthropic API parameters:
     - Fixed the system message format (using `system` parameter instead of `"role": "system"` in messages)
     - Updated model specification to `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219` (current model)
     - Removed invalid `tool_choice` parameter causing 400 errors
   - Added timing measurements to confirm live API usage

2. Created diagnostic tools for testing the live LLM integration:
   - Developed `test_live_llm_setup_fix.py` to verify environment configuration
   - Added direct Claude API connection test
   - Improved logging around API calls and responses
   - Added explicit "mock: false" flag in responses to clearly indicate live mode

3. Enhanced error handling and monitoring:
   - Added more verbose logging around API calls
   - Implemented timing metrics to verify real API usage vs. mock responses

### Current Status

The system now successfully makes API calls to Claude (verified by response time > 6 seconds), but there's still an issue with processing tool use responses:

```
Error calling Anthropic API: 'ToolUseBlock' object has no attribute 'tool_use'
```

This indicates that the API response format for tool use has changed and needs further updates to properly extract the tool calls from the response.

### Next Steps

1. Update tool use response processing code to match current Anthropic API structure
2. Fix the `'EnhancedOntologyServerWithGuidelines' object has no attribute 'get_ontology_sources'` error
3. Complete end-to-end testing:
   - Run database cleanup with `run_cleanup_guideline_concepts.py` 
   - Test full workflow in UI with real guideline extraction
   - Verify extracted concepts are being properly saved
   - Confirm triples can be generated and saved from live-extracted concepts

### Environment Status

- Successfully configured non-mock environment (`USE_MOCK_GUIDELINE_RESPONSES=false`)
- Verified API keys are properly configured and working (direct API test passes)
- MCP server successfully starts with live LLM mode enabled
- API calls are being made to Claude with 6-7 second response times (confirming live usage)
