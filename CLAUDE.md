## 2025-04-24: Implemented Ontology Editor Integration

The ontology editor has been successfully integrated into the ProEthica application. This integration allows for direct editing of ontologies associated with worlds, as well as specific editing of individual entities.

### Changes Made:
1. **Extended MCPClient Service**:
   - Added methods for ontology status checking
   - Added methods for fetching and updating ontology content
   - Added methods for refreshing world entities after ontology changes

2. **Created Bridge Routes**:
   - Added `app/routes/ontology.py` with bridging functionality
   - Registered the ontology blueprint in `app/__init__.py`

3. **UI Integration**:
   - Updated the world detail template to show ontology status
   - Added "Edit Ontology" buttons to world details page
   - Added "Edit in Ontology" functionality to entity detail modals
   - Created JavaScript file to handle entity editing integration

4. **Documentation**:
   - Created detailed integration documentation

### How to Use:
- The ontologies can be accessed/edited from the world details page
- Individual entities can be edited by clicking on the "Details" button for an entity and then "Edit in Ontology"
- All changes to ontologies automatically update the associated worlds

### Next Steps:
- Create custom entity types beyond the default five types (roles, conditions, resources, events, actions)
- Implement proper versioning UI for ontologies
- Add ability to revert to previous ontology versions

## 2025-04-22: Extended Proethica with Agent-Based Architecture

We've successfully implemented the agent-based architecture to enhance the ethical reasoning capabilities. The new system supports multiple types of agents, each specialized for different tasks.

### Changes Made:
1. Added agent module with support for:
   - Guidelines agent for retrieving and interpreting ethical guidelines
   - Scenario agent for analyzing scenarios
   - Entity agent for entity relationship analysis
   
2. Implemented a communication protocol between agents

3. Set up test cases to validate the agent architecture

### Next Steps:
- Enhance agent reasoning with more sophisticated ethical frameworks
- Add support for dynamic agent creation based on scenario context
- Implement visualization of agent reasoning process

## 2025-04-10: Improved World Entities and Triple Relationships

Added better support for entity triple relationships and improved the world entity management interface.

### Changes Made:
1. Enhanced the triple data model with temporal attributes
2. Added UI for visualizing entity relationships
3. Implemented filtering and search for entities

### Known Issues:
- Some performance issues with large entity graphs
- Occasional glitches in the visualization UI

## 2025-04-03: Initial Setup of Model Context Protocol

Implemented the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for better integration with AI services.

### Changes Made:
1. Created MCP server integration
2. Set up HTTP MCP server for ontology management
3. Added client API for MCP server communication
