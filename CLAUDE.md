# ProEthica Development Log

This file tracks progress, decisions, and important changes to the ProEthica system.

### Improved ontology consistency and Capability class integration

- Enhanced ontology consistency between base, intermediate, and domain ontologies:
  - Added Capability class to ProEthica Intermediate Ontology (properly subclassed from BFO_0000016 - disposition)
  - Added CapabilityType to entity types recognized by the MCP server
  - Updated EngineeringCapability in Engineering Ethics NSPE Extended to properly subclass from proeth:Capability
  - Created verification script (verify_ontology_consistency.py) to check ontology hierarchy consistency
- Created necessary scripts for ontology management:
  - update_ontology_with_capability.py - Adds Capability class to intermediate ontology
  - update_engineering_capability.py - Properly connects domain capabilities to intermediate ontology
  - These scripts maintain correct version history in the database

### Protected base ontologies and consolidated documentation

- Implemented protection for base ontologies (BFO):
  - Created `scripts/protect_base_ontologies.py` to mark core ontologies as non-editable
  - Added is_base and is_editable flags to prevent modification of foundation ontologies
  - Preserved ability to view and import from base ontologies
  - Laid groundwork for future admin-only base ontology uploads
- Simplified ontology documentation structure:
  - Created comprehensive `docs/unified_ontology_system.md` documentation
  - Updated `ontology_editor/README.md` to reference database storage
  - Removed redundant/outdated documentation files
  - Maintained only essential documentation for current architecture
- Improved UI integration:
  - Added Ontology Editor link to main navigation
  - Enhanced documentation of visualization features

### Next Steps:
- Run the protect_base_ontologies.py script to secure core ontologies
- Update Engineering NSPE Extended capabilities to utilize the proper Capability class attributes
- Consider adding other domain-specific capability subtypes to the intermediate ontology
- Implement enhanced ontology visualization features with hierarchy view
- Add admin interface for base ontology management
- Optimize performance for large ontologies

### Updated ontology storage to use database-only system

- Created system for migrating ontologies from files to database storage
- Added patch to MCP server to prioritize database ontology loading with fallback to files
- Created scripts for the migration process:
  - `scripts/archive_ontology_files.py`: Archives original TTL files before replacement
  - `scripts/update_ontology_mcp_server.py`: Patches MCP server to load from database
  - `scripts/remove_ontology_files.py`: Replaces TTL files with placeholders
  - `scripts/setup_ontology_db_only.sh`: Combined script for the complete migration process
- Main benefits:
  - Eliminates inconsistencies between file and database versions
  - Enables proper version tracking through the database
  - Maintains compatibility with existing code through fallback mechanisms
  - Original files archived for reference if needed
