## May 19, 2025 (Update #59): Fixed Multiple Questions Extraction in NSPE Pipeline

### Implementation Completed
Fixed and enhanced the NSPE case extraction pipeline to properly handle multiple questions in case content. Previously, the extraction was incomplete and would truncate when trying to extract multiple questions, but now it properly recognizes ordered and unordered lists of questions and extracts each question as a separate item.

### Key Improvements
1. **Multiple Questions Extraction**:
   - Enhanced the existing question extraction logic to handle structured question lists
   - Properly implemented the `_extract_individual_questions` method to parse both ordered (`ol`) and unordered (`ul`) lists
   - Added support for traditional question formats used in NSPE cases like:
     ```html
     <div class="field__item"><ol><li>Question 1</li><li>Question 2</li><li>Question 3</li></ol></div>
     ```
   - Fixed the HTML processing to properly handle the DOM structure of question sections

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Fixed the incomplete try/except block in the process method
   - Added proper exception handling and error reporting
   - Implemented graceful fallbacks when specific extraction patterns fail
   - Enhanced logging throughout the extraction process

3. **Code Structure**:
   - Completed the implementation of the NSPECaseExtractionStep class
   - Added thorough docstrings and comments for maintainability
   - Ensured proper HTML cleaning and processing throughout the pipeline
   - Improved consistency in return values and error handling

### Verification
Validated the solution with the URL https://www.nspe.org/career-growth/ethics/board-ethical-review-cases/acknowledging-errors-design which contains three ethical questions:
1. Was it ethical for Engineer T and Engineer B to conclude an error had not been made in design?
2. Was it ethical for Engineer T not to acknowledge an error after the accident occurred?
3. Was it ethical for Engineer T not to acknowledge an error during the deposition?

The system now properly extracts all three questions as separate items in the `questions_list` array while preserving the HTML structure in the `question_html` field for backward compatibility.

### Next Steps
1. Continue enhancing the pipeline with additional features:
   - Implement semantic analysis of extracted questions
   - Add support for categorizing questions by ethical principles involved
   - Create visualization of relationships between questions and relevant code sections

2. Integrate with the ontology system:
   - Map extracted questions to ontology concepts
   - Generate triples based on question content
   - Create connections between questions and relevant ethical principles

## May 19, 2025 (Update #58): Enhanced Multiple Questions Extraction in NSPE Case Processing

### Implementation Completed
Enhanced the NSPE case extraction pipeline to properly handle multiple questions in case content. Previously, the system would only extract a single question, but now it supports extracting an ordered list of multiple questions that are commonly found in engineering ethics cases.

### Key Improvements
1. **Multiple Questions Extraction**:
   - Added a new method `_extract_individual_questions` that parses HTML content for question lists
   - Enhanced the extraction logic to identify both ordered and unordered lists of questions
   - Created a separate `questions_list` array in the extraction output to store multiple individual questions
   - Maintained backward compatibility by preserving the original HTML output in the `question` field

2. **Template Enhancement**:
   - Updated the `case_extracted_content.html` template to detect and properly display multiple questions
   - Implemented conditional logic to show either a single question or a numbered list based on content
   - Added adaptive header that switches between "Question" and "Questions" based on count
   - Ensured graceful fallback to original HTML content when multiple questions cannot be extracted

3. **Extraction Logic Improvements**:
   - Added support for both ordered (`ol`) and unordered (`ul`) lists in question content
   - Implemented intelligent content parsing that extracts each list item as a separate question
   - Maintained fallback to extract single questions when no list structure is found
   - Added robust text cleaning for extracted question content

### Technical Details
- The NSPE HTML structure for questions often follows this pattern:
  ```html
  <div class="field__item"><ol><li>Question 1</li><li>Question 2</li><li>Question 3</li></ol></div>
  ```
- The new extraction logic now properly parses this structure to extract each list item
- When no list structure is found, the system creates a single-item list from the question text
- The extraction pipeline now adds a new `questions_list` to the result dictionary while maintaining the original HTML in `sections.question` for backward compatibility

### Verification
Successfully tested the implementation with the NSPE case "Acknowledging Errors in Design" which contains three ethical questions:
1. Was it ethical for Engineer T and Engineer B to conclude an error had not been made in design?
2. Was it ethical for Engineer T not to acknowledge an error after the accident occurred?
3. Was it ethical for Engineer T not to acknowledge an error during the deposition?

The system properly extracted all three questions as separate items while preserving the overall structure.

### Next Steps
1. **Enhanced Question Analysis**:
   - Add support for detecting sub-questions or multi-part questions
   - Implement natural language processing to identify question types and categories
   - Create relationships between questions for cases where one question builds on another

2. **Data Integration**:
   - Use extracted questions to improve ontology mapping of ethical issues
   - Add metadata to questions to track recurring ethical themes across cases
   - Enhance the knowledge graph with question-specific relationships

3. **User Interface Improvements**:
   - Add highlighting for significant terms in questions
   - Implement filtering and searching based on question content
   - Create links between related questions across different cases

## May 19, 2025 (Update #57): Enhanced NSPE Case Extraction to Preserve Links and References

### Implementation Completed

   - Added functionality to convert relative URLs to absolute URLs using the base URL of the case
   - Implemented detection and special handling for links to other NSPE cases 
   - Created a new `linked_cases` field in the extraction output that catalogs all referenced cases

2. **Case Reference Detection**:
   - Added regex-based detection of case references in text (e.g., "Case 20-1") even when not hyperlinked
   - Implemented a `_mark_case_references` method that wraps these references in span elements with a special class
   - Enhanced the extraction to identify both linked and text-based references to other cases

3. **HTML Handling Improvements**:
   - Added more sophisticated HTML cleaning that preserves link structure while removing unnecessary elements
   - Implemented context-aware HTML extraction that maintains the document structure
   - Created a base URL handling system to ensure all links remain functional in extracted content
   - Added special handling to unwrap unnecessary div elements while preserving their content

### Technical Details
- **New Methods Added**:
  - `_clean_html_preserve_links`: Cleans HTML while preserving anchor tags and their attributes
  - `_mark_case_references`: Identifies and marks textual references to other cases 
  - Several helper methods to handle different HTML structural patterns

- **Output Enhancements**:
  - Added a new `linked_cases` array in the extraction result with both link text and URLs
  - Preserved HTML formatting in all sections, particularly in the Discussion section where case references are common

### Verification
Tested with the NSPE case "23-4: Acknowledging Errors in Design" to confirm that:
1. All hyperlinks in the Discussion section are properly preserved
2. Text-based references to other cases are now identified and marked
3. All section extraction continues to work correctly with the enhanced HTML handling

### Next Steps
1. **Reference Normalization**:
   - Develop a consistent format for case references (standardize formats like "Case 20-1" vs "BER Case 20-1")
   - Create a mapping system to correlate case references with their full details

2. **User Interface Enhancement**:
   - Improve the display of linked cases in the UI
   - Add tooltips or preview functionality for referenced cases
   - Implement navigation between related cases

3. **Triple Generation Integration**:
   - Use the identified links between cases to generate semantic triples
   - Create "references" or "cites" relationships between cases in the knowledge graph

## May 19, 2025 (Update #53): Fixed Ontology Editor 404 Error

### Task Completed
Fixed the 404 error occurring when accessing the `/ontology-editor` route by properly registering the ontology_editor blueprint in the Flask application.

### Key Improvements
1. **Blueprint Registration Fix**:
   - Added the import statement for the `create_ontology_editor_blueprint` function in `app/__init__.py`
   - Created the ontology editor blueprint with appropriate configuration
   - Added the registration of the blueprint with the Flask application
   - Successfully restored access to the ontology editor functionality

2. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - The ontology_editor module was implemented correctly with all necessary templates and routes
   - All required code and assets were present in the ontology_editor directory
   - The issue was simply that the blueprint was defined but never registered with the Flask application
   - The registration step is essential for Flask to recognize and route requests to the blueprint's handlers

3. **Verification**:
   - Confirmed the ontology editor is working by accessing the route in a browser
   - Successfully loaded the ontology list and editor interface
   - Server logs showed proper 200 response codes for the `/ontology-editor/` endpoint and related assets

### Technical Details
- The fix required adding three sections to `app/__init__.py`:
  ```python
  # Import the blueprint creation function
  from ontology_editor import create_ontology_editor_blueprint
  
  # Create the ontology editor blueprint with configuration
  ontology_editor_bp = create_ontology_editor_blueprint(
      config={
          'require_auth': True,   # Enable authentication
          'admin_only': False     # Allow all authenticated users to access
      }
  )
  
  # Register the blueprint with the Flask app
  app.register_blueprint(ontology_editor_bp)
  ```
- The ontology editor now properly loads showing the available ontologies (Basic Formal Ontology, Engineering Ethics, ProEthica Intermediate Ontology)
- The interface is fully functional with editing, validation, and visualization capabilities

## May 18, 2025 (Update #52): Fixed Cases Route 404 Error

### Task Completed
Fixed the 404 error occurring when accessing the `/cases` route by properly registering the cases blueprint in the Flask application.

### Key Improvements
1. **Blueprint Registration Fix**:
   - Added the import statement for the cases blueprint in `app/__init__.py`  
   - Added the registration of the cases blueprint with the correct URL prefix
   - Successfully restored access to the cases functionality of the application

2. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - The cases blueprint was implemented correctly in `app/routes/cases.py`
   - All the necessary templates were already created
   - The issue was simply that the blueprint was defined but never registered with the Flask application
   - This registration step is essential for Flask to recognize and route requests to the blueprint's handlers

3. **Verification**:
   - Restarted the Flask development server
   - Confirmed the route is working with a browser test
   - Server logs showed successful 200 response codes for the `/cases` endpoint

### Technical Details
- The fix was straightforward - adding two lines to `app/__init__.py`:
  ```python
  from app.routes.cases import cases_bp
  app.register_blueprint(cases_bp, url_prefix='/cases')
  ```
- This properly connects the cases blueprint implementation with the Flask application's routing system
- The cases page now displays correctly, showing the list of engineering ethics cases stored in the system

# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Claude Model Version Requirements ⚠️

## Required Claude Model Versions
- **Use ONLY** these model versions:
  - `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219` (preferred)
  - `claude-3-7-sonnet-latest` (alternative)

## Warning About Older Model Versions
DO NOT use older model versions like `claude-3-7-sonnet-20240229` or similar, as they are incompatible with the current codebase and API implementations. Using incorrect model versions causes:
- API compatibility errors
- Missing type definitions (`RawMessageStreamEvent` etc.)
- Fallbacks to mock responses
- Broken functionality across the system

## Model Version Checklist
When making code changes that involve Claude API:
1. Verify model version strings match one of the approved versions above
2. Never revert to older model dates (20240229 instead of 20250219)
3. Double-check API parameter compatibility with the specified model
4. Test with the actual API before committing changes

## May 18, 2025 (Update #51): Planned LLM-Enhanced Triple Generation (Phase 2)

### Issue Analysis
Analyzed and identified the cause of the "Error getting entities: 404" error in the triple generation workflow:
- The error occurs when MCPClient attempts to access ontology entities at `/api/ontology/engineering-ethics/entities`
- The issue is related to the URL path handling between the client and server
- The server is configured to respond to this path but has internal confusion with file extension handling

### Next Enhancement: LLM-Enhanced Triple Generation
Developed implementation plan for Phase 2 of the triple generation system:

1. **Current Status**: 
   - Phase 1 is complete and working for basic triple generation
   - Current system handles basic types, standard properties, and simple domain-specific relationships

2. **Enhancement Goal**:
   - Add LLM-enhanced capability to identify implicit semantic relationships
   - Create more meaningful connections between concepts based on semantic understanding
   - Generate richer triple contexts with confidence scores and explanations
   - Provide fallback to basic generation for critical reliability

3. **Implementation Approach**:
   - Extend the API interface with new parameters for LLM enhancement
   - Create a specialized prompt template for semantic triple generation
   - Implement proper merging of basic and LLM-generated triples
   - Add quality control with confidence thresholds

4. **Technical Considerations**:
   - Token usage will increase with LLM enhancement
   - Performance optimizations including caching and batch processing
   - Consistent URI handling between basic and enhanced methods
   - Proper fallback mechanisms to ensure reliability
