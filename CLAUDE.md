## May 14, 2025: Flask Blueprint URL Routing Reference

### Important Note on URL Routing with Blueprints

When using Flask blueprints, URL endpoints must be referenced with the blueprint name prefix:

**Correct format for blueprint routes:**
```python
url_for('blueprint_name.route_name')  # Example: url_for('index.index')
```

**Incorrect format (causes BuildError):**
```python
url_for('route_name')  # Example: url_for('index') - This will fail!
```

Common errors that occur when this pattern is not followed:
```
werkzeug.routing.exceptions.BuildError: Could not build url for endpoint 'main.index'. Did you mean 'index.index' instead?
```

Most common incorrectly referenced endpoints that need to be updated:
- `main.index` → `index.index`
- `index` → `index.index`

This applies to:
- Templates using `url_for()`
- Python code using `redirect(url_for())`
- Any other use of `url_for()`

Always check template files first when encountering URL routing errors after blueprint refactoring.

## May 14, 2025: Concept Extraction Feature Fix

### Task Completed
Fixed the guideline concept extraction functionality to ensure concepts are displayed when the "Analyze Concepts" button is clicked.

### Changes Made
1. Fixed the incomplete `generate_triples` method in `GuidelineAnalysisService` class:
   - Completed the method implementation that was previously truncated
   - Ensured proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
   - Added proper type handling for different concept types (roles, principles, obligations)

2. Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/concept_extraction_implementation.md` that outlines:
   - Background of the feature
   - Existing architecture
   - Implementation plan
   - Technical details about the concept extraction process
   - Troubleshooting steps
   - Testing process
   - Future improvements

### How to Test
1. Navigate to a guideline page
2. Click the "Analyze Concepts" button
3. Verify that concepts are extracted and displayed in the concept review page
4. Select some concepts and save them
5. Verify that the selected concepts appear on the guideline page

### Current Architecture
The concept extraction process involves several components:

1. **UI Components**:
   - `guideline_content.html` - Contains the "Analyze Concepts" button
   - `guideline_extracted_concepts.html` - Displays the extracted concepts for review

2. **Routes**:
   - `worlds_extract_only.py` - Contains routes for extracting concepts directly
   - `worlds_direct_concepts.py` - Provides direct concept extraction implementation
   - `fix_concept_extraction.py` - Ensures concept extraction works even when LLM is unavailable

3. **Services**:
   - `GuidelineAnalysisService` - Handles the extraction and processing of concepts

### Flow
1. User clicks "Analyze Concepts" on a guideline page
2. The route handler calls `GuidelineAnalysisService.extract_concepts()`
3. Concepts are extracted (first trying MCP server, then falling back to direct LLM if needed)
4. The extracted concepts are displayed in the concept review page
5. User selects which concepts to save
6. Selected concepts are processed and saved for the guideline

### Notes
- The fixed implementation preserves the original architecture and API contracts
- The system will now properly handle concept extraction even when the MCP server or LLM is unavailable
- The feature now works consistently across the application

## May 14, 2025: LLM Connection Improvements and Model Updates

### Task Completed
Enhanced the LLM connection functionality and implemented robust fallback mechanisms for concept extraction to ensure the feature works even when LLM services are unavailable.

### Changes Made
1. Created a standalone test script (`test_llm_connection.py`):
   - Script tests LLM connectivity outside the Flask application context
   - Provides detailed logging of connection attempts and issues
   - Tests both simple completions and concept extraction with sample guidelines
   - Helps diagnose LLM connection issues independently

2. Enhanced fallback mechanism in `GuidelineAnalysisService`:
   - Improved fallback logic to clearly indicate when mock concepts are being used
   - Added better error reporting with specific error messages
   - Ensured mock concepts are generated even when all LLM connections fail

3. Updated LLM model references:
   - Changed from `claude-3-opus-20240229` to `claude-3-7-sonnet-latest` or `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`
   - Updated all API calls to use the new models
   - Maintained compatibility with different Anthropic SDK versions

4. Documented concept extraction implementation:
   - Added detailed explanation of the concept extraction process
   - Included testing procedures and troubleshooting steps
   - Outlined future improvements for the feature

### How to Test LLM Connection
1. Set the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable:
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

2. Run the test script:
   ```bash
   python test_llm_connection.py
   ```

3. Check the output for connection status, successful completions, and concept extraction results

### Notes
- The system now gracefully degrades when LLM is unavailable by providing mock concepts
- The test script helps isolate LLM connection issues from application logic problems
- Model updates ensure the application uses the latest available Claude models
- Even without a valid API key, the concept extraction feature will work with generated mock concepts
