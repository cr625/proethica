### Consolidated ontology documentation and completed database migration

- Simplified ontology documentation structure:
  - Created comprehensive `docs/unified_ontology_system.md` documentation
  - Updated `ontology_editor/README.md` to reference database storage
  - Removed redundant/outdated documentation files
  - Maintained only essential documentation for current architecture
- Successfully tested database-only ontology system, confirming:
  - Editor works correctly with database storage
  - Visualization endpoints function properly
  - MCP server correctly loads ontologies from database

### Next Steps:
- Implement enhanced ontology visualization features
- Add real-time collaborative editing capabilities
- Optimize performance for large ontologies

### Updated ontology storage to use database-only system

- Created system for migrating ontologies from files to database storage
- Added patch to MCP server to prioritize database ontology loading with fallback to files
- Created scripts for the migration process:
  - `scripts/archive_ontology_files.py`: Archives original TTL files before replacement
  - `scripts/update_ontology_mcp_server.py`: Patches MCP server to load from database
  - `scripts/remove_ontology_files.py`: Replaces TTL files with placeholders
  - `scripts/setup_ontology_db_only.sh`: Combined script for the complete migration process
- Main benefits:
  - Eliminates inconsistencies between file and database versions
  - Enables proper version tracking through the database
  - Maintains compatibility with existing code through fallback mechanisms
  - Original files archived for reference if needed
