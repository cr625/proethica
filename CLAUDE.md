# ProEthica Development Log

This file tracks progress, decisions, and important changes to the ProEthica system.

## 2025-04-25 - Ontology System Standardization

### Implemented Changes

1. **Standardized Database-Driven Ontology Access**
   - Refactored MCP server to natively work with database-stored ontologies
   - Removed dependency on the file-based patch approach
   - Updated MCP server documentation to reflect database-first approach
   - Created consolidated documentation in `docs/ontology_system.md`

2. **Unified Ontology Documentation**
   - Created a comprehensive ontology system document
   - Consolidated information from multiple ontology-related documents
   - Removed references to file-based ontology handling
   - Updated READMEs to reflect current database-driven architecture

3. **MCP Server Improvements**
   - Enhanced database loading with better error handling
   - Maintained backward compatibility with file-based fallback
   - Improved documentation for troubleshooting
   - Added context for entity types and their relationships

### Benefits

- Consistent ontology handling across all system components
- Single source of truth for all ontology data
- More reliable integration between MCP server and database
- Clearer documentation for developers and maintainers
- Improved maintainability and easier debugging

### Files Modified

- `mcp/http_ontology_mcp_server.py`
- `mcp/README.md`
- `ontology_editor/README.md`
- Created new `docs/ontology_system.md`

## 2025-04-25 - Ontology Editor Improvements

### Fixes Implemented

1. **Fixed Entity Extraction in Ontology Editor**
   - Created a direct database-based entity extraction approach
   - Modified the ontology editor API to use the same entity extraction service as the world detail page
   - Eliminated dependency on the MCP server for entity extraction
   - Ensured consistent entity display between world detail page and ontology editor

2. **Improved URL Management in Ontology Editor**
   - Updated the ontology editor to properly update the URL when switching between ontologies
   - Added browser history support for better navigation
   - Preserved view parameters for consistent user experience
   - Enabled proper sharing of links to specific ontologies

3. **Fixed Ontology Validation**
   - Modified how ontology content is sent for validation to prevent parsing errors
   - Updated backend validation route to properly handle JSON data
   - Improved error handling and debugging for validation issues
   - Enhanced error messages to better identify syntax errors in ontologies

4. **Made Navigation Consistent Across App**
   - Added Ontology Editor link to world detail page navigation
   - Ensured consistent user experience throughout the application
   - Improved discoverability of the ontology editor functionality
   - Streamlined workflow between world details and ontology editing

### Benefits

- More reliable entity extraction without HTTP call dependency
- Consistent experience between different parts of the application
- Better navigation through proper URL management
- Improved validation process for ontology development

### Next Steps

- Consider adding syntax highlighting for ontology errors in the editor
- Implement more detailed validation feedback with line numbers and error locations
- Explore automatic syntax fixing options for common ontology errors
## 2025-04-24

### Updated ontology storage to use database-only system

- Created system for migrating ontologies from files to database storage
- Added patch to MCP server to prioritize database ontology loading with fallback to files
- Created scripts for the migration process:
  - `scripts/archive_ontology_files.py`: Archives original TTL files before replacement
  - `scripts/update_ontology_mcp_server.py`: Patches MCP server to load from database
  - `scripts/remove_ontology_files.py`: Replaces TTL files with placeholders
  - `scripts/setup_ontology_db_only.sh`: Combined script for the complete migration process
- Main benefits:
  - Eliminates inconsistencies between file and database versions
  - Enables proper version tracking through the database
  - Maintains compatibility with existing code through fallback mechanisms
  - Original files archived for reference if needed
