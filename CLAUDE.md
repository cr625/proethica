## May 18, 2025 (Update #45): Fixed ORM Property References in MCP Client

### Task Completed
Fixed an issue where the application was trying to access a non-existent 'source' property on the Ontology model. This was causing errors during entity loading with the message "Error checking ontology status: Entity namespace for 'ontologies' has no property 'source'".

### Key Improvements
1. **Fixed Database Property Reference**:
   - Changed references from `source` to `domain_id` in the MCPClient class
   - The Ontology model has a `domain_id` column but not a `source` column
   - Updated the query in the `get_ontology_status` method to use the correct field name

2. **Error Resolution**:
   - Resolved the error: `Error checking ontology status: Entity namespace for "ontologies" has no property "source"`
   - Improved error handling to provide more helpful messages when accessing database entities
   - Added clearer logging to help diagnose similar issues in the future

3. **Technical Details**:
   - The issue was in `app/services/mcp_client.py` where it was using `Ontology.query.filter_by(source=ontology_source).first()`
   - Changed to use `Ontology.query.filter_by(domain_id=ontology_source).first()` which matches the actual schema
   - This allows proper lookup of ontologies by their domain identifier which is critical for guideline concept extraction

### Next Steps
1. **Database Schema Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation of the database schema to prevent similar issues
2. **Code Auditing**: Review other parts of the codebase for similar ORM property mismatches
3. **Testing**: Implement additional tests to verify database entity access works correctly
4. **Data Validation**: Add validation to ensure data consistency between the MCP server and Flask application

## May 18, 2025 (Update #44): Fixed Database Configuration Handling in MCP Server

### Task Completed
Fixed the SQL database configuration error in the Enhanced Ontology MCP Server that was appearing during guideline concept extraction. The issue was resolved by improving database configuration handling and fixing the table name references.

### Key Improvements
1. **Fixed Database Configuration Handling**:
   - Created a new `fix_flask_db_config.py` module to properly set up Flask database configuration
   - Implemented proper environment variable handling for database connection
   - Ensured database configuration is set before Flask app initialization
   - Fixed the error: `RuntimeError: Either 'SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI' or 'SQLALCHEMY_BINDS' must be set`

2. **Fixed Table Name References**:
   - Identified that the code was looking for an "ontology" table but the actual table name is "ontologies" (plural)
   - Updated all SQL queries to reference the correct table name
   - Implemented domain ID format standardization (hyphen vs underscore)
   - Added better error handling and more detailed logging

3. **Improved Module Import System**:
   - Added a backward compatibility alias in `base_module.py` to support existing modules
   - Fixed the error: `ImportError: cannot import name 'BaseModule' from 'mcp.modules.base_module'`
   - Ensured proper module initialization order to prevent circular imports
   - Created stable module interfaces for future development

4. **Enhanced Server Management**:
   - Created a restart script (`restart_mcp_server.sh`) to easily restart the MCP server
   - Added server health checking to verify proper startup
   - Implemented proper database session handling throughout the codebase
   - Added improved environment variable handling in server scripts

### Technical Details
1. **Database Configuration Fix**:
   - Set `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` environment variable before Flask app initialization
   - Created functions to safely manage Flask app context for database operations
   - Used direct SQLAlchemy engine creation as a fallback when Flask app context fails
   - Implemented detailed error logging to trace configuration issues

2. **Table Name and Schema Handling**:
   - Updated the query from `SELECT id, content FROM ontology` to `SELECT id, content FROM ontologies`
   - Added domain ID format standardization to match database conventions
   - Implemented column mapping based on actual database schema
   - Added detailed logging of database schema checks and query results

### Next Steps
1. **Advanced Error Handling**: Further enhance error handling by implementing detailed error types and recovery strategies
2. **Performance Optimization**: Monitor and optimize database query performance for ontology loading
3. **Caching Implementation**: Consider adding caching for frequently used ontology data to reduce database load
4. **Monitoring Setup**: Implement proper monitoring for database connections and performance metrics

## May 18, 2025 (Update #43): Fixed SQL Error in MCP Server

### Task Completed
Fixed the SQL error in the Enhanced Ontology MCP Server by implementing a direct database connection approach instead of using Flask app context.

### Key Improvements
1. **Identified Root Cause**:
   - The error message: `Error loading from database: Either 'SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI' or 'SQLALCHEMY_BINDS' must be set.`
   - The MCP server was trying to create a Flask app context to access the database but wasn't properly inheriting environment variables
   - This caused the database configuration to be missing when the app context was created

2. **Implemented Clean Solution**:
   - Modified `_load_graph_from_file` method in `mcp/http_ontology_mcp_server.py` to use SQLAlchemy directly
   - Removed dependency on Flask app context for database operations
   - Used environment variables with proper fallback for database connection URL
   - Implemented proper session handling with cleanup
   - Maintained detailed logging for debugging purposes

3. **Technical Details**:
   - Used SQLAlchemy core functionality to create direct database connection
   - Configured connection with `DATABASE_URL` from environment with fallback to `postgresql://postgres:PASS@localhost:5433/ai_ethical_dm`
   - Implemented proper SQL query to directly fetch ontology content from the database
   - Ensured database sessions are properly closed after use

### Next Steps
1. **Test MCP Server**: Restart the MCP server to verify the fix works in practice
2. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for any new errors in the MCP server logs
3. **Consider Configuration Refactoring**: Evaluate centralizing database configuration to avoid similar issues
4. **Documentation Update**: Update technical documentation with details of this implementation change

## May 18, 2025 (Update #42): Fixed Flask Debug Server Restart Issue

### Task Completed
Fixed an issue where the Flask development server was unnecessarily restarting during initialization, causing a double-startup sequence that wasted time during development.

### Key Improvements
1. **Identified Root Cause**:
   - Determined that the filesystem-based session storage (`SESSION_TYPE = 'filesystem'`) was triggering Flask's reloader
   - When Flask created session files during initialization, the reloader detected these file changes
   - This caused the "Restarting with stat" behavior we were seeing after every initial startup

2. **Implemented Clean Solution**:
   - Modified `run_debug_app.py` to disable the auto-reloader while keeping other debug features
   - Used `app.run(debug=True, use_reloader=False)` to maintain enhanced error pages and other debug benefits
   - Properly documented the change with clear comments explaining the reason

3. **Verified Results**:
   - The application now starts up cleanly without the unnecessary restart
   - Debug features like enhanced error pages are still available
   - Development workflow is more efficient with faster startup times

### Technical Details
The issue was in how Flask's development server works:

1. When `debug=True` is set, Flask enables an auto-reloader that watches for file changes
2. Our application was configured to use filesystem sessions (`SESSION_TYPE = 'filesystem'` in `app/config.py`)
3. During initialization, Flask creates session files, which triggered file change events
4. These events caused the reloader to restart the application, creating a wasteful cycle

Our solution separates these concerns by:
- Keeping `debug=True` for its development benefits (better error pages, console tracebacks)
- Setting `use_reloader=False` to prevent the file change monitoring that caused the restart

This approach is ideal for development in environments like GitHub Codespaces where you want debug features but don't need the auto-reloader (which can be problematic with filesystem sessions).

### Next Steps
1. **Consider Update to VSCode Launch Config**: Update launch configurations to use the same settings
2. **Document in Development Guide**: Add a note about this in the development workflow documentation
3. **Evaluate Session Storage**: Consider if filesystem sessions are necessary or if another storage mechanism might be better for development

## May 18, 2025 (Update #41): Optimized Application Startup by Removing Schema Verification

### Task Completed
Optimized the Flask application startup process by removing the automatic database schema verification that was causing unnecessary application restarts during development.

### Key Improvements
1. **Streamlined Application Initialization**:
   - Modified `app/__init__.py` to remove schema verification during application startup
   - Replaced it with a simple database connection test that doesn't modify files
   - Eliminated the unnecessary Flask restart that was occurring during initialization
   - Reduced application startup time by preventing the double-initialization sequence

2. **Dedicated Schema Verification Tool**:
   - Created a standalone `verify_database_schema.py` script for schema verification
   - The script performs all the same checks previously done at startup
   - Includes proper command-line options for check-only mode and custom database URLs
   - Provides clear output with color-coded success/failure messages

3. **Best Practices Implementation**:
   - Separated concerns by moving schema verification out of application initialization
   - Applied principle of minimal side effects during application startup
   - Improved developer experience with faster startup times
   - Created clear documentation for when to run schema verification

### Technical Details
The implementation addresses two specific issues:

1. **Removed the cause of restart**:
   - Flask's debug mode automatically restarts the application when it detects file changes
   - The schema verification code was potentially modifying files during startup
   - This caused Flask to restart immediately after starting, creating a doubled startup sequence
   - By removing schema verification from startup, we eliminated this problem

2. **Created a dedicated utility**:
   The new `verify_database_schema.py` script:
   - Provides the same verification functionality as before
   - Should be run explicitly when updating the codebase with new models
   - Includes better error reporting and options than the previous implementation
   - Can be run in check-only mode to verify without making changes

### Next Steps
1. **Update Documentation**: Add notes about when to run schema verification in development workflows
2. **Consider Database Migrations**: Evaluate using a proper migration tool (like Alembic) for schema changes
3. **Startup Performance**: Continue to optimize application startup time for development workflow
4. **Test Coverage**: Add tests for database schema verification to ensure continued reliability

## May 18, 2025 (Update #40): Fixed Ontology File Loading for Guideline Concept Extraction

### Task Completed
Fixed a critical issue in the HTTP Ontology MCP Server that was causing "Ontology file not found" errors during guideline concept extraction by implementing proper file extension handling and fallback paths.

### Key Improvements
1. **Enhanced Ontology File Path Handling**:
   - Modified `_load_graph_from_file` method in `http_ontology_mcp_server.py` to properly handle file extensions
   - Added automatic `.ttl` extension appending when not specified in the ontology source parameter
   - Implemented a fallback path mechanism to check both with and without extension
   - Added detailed error logging showing which paths were checked

2. **Error Resolution**:
   - Fixed the error: `Error: Ontology file not found: /workspaces/ai-ethical-dm/mcp/ontology/engineering_ethics`
   - Resolved the issue where the server couldn't find ontology files when no extension was specified
   - Addressed the underlying cause of parser failures in guideline concept extraction

3. **Testing and Verification**:
   - Created `test_extract_concepts.py` to verify guideline concept extraction works through the MCP server API
   - Successfully extracted concepts from NSPE Code of Ethics text
   - Confirmed the extraction of Public Safety (principle), Professional Competence (obligation), and Honesty in Communication (obligation) concepts

### Technical Details
The problem was in the `_load_graph_from_file` method in `http_ontology_mcp_server.py`. When the `ontology_source` parameter was provided without a `.ttl` extension (e.g., "engineering_ethics"), the code was:
1. Attempting to find the file directly with that name
2. Not appending the `.ttl` extension automatically
3. Failing with "Ontology file not found" since the actual file was named "engineering_ethics.ttl"

The solution:
```python
# Standardize the ontology_source handling
if ontology_source.endswith('.ttl'):
    domain_id = ontology_source[:-4]  # Remove .ttl extension
else:
    domain_id = ontology_source
    # Ensure we look for the file with extension if not specified
    ontology_source = f"{ontology_source}.ttl"

# Check both with and without extension
ontology_path = os.path.join(ONTOLOGY_DIR, ontology_source)
if not os.path.exists(ontology_path):
    # Try without extension as fallback
    fallback_path = os.path.join(ONTOLOGY_DIR, domain_id)
    if os.path.exists(fallback_path):
        ontology_path = fallback_path
        print(f"Using fallback path: {ontology_path}", file=sys.stderr)
    else:
        print(f"Error: Ontology file not found: {ontology_path}", file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"Also checked: {fallback_path}", file=sys.stderr)
        return g
```

This approach ensures that regardless of whether the ontology source is specified with or without the `.ttl` extension, the system will find the file if it exists in either form. This robust handling fixed the issue causing the guideline concept extraction to fail.

### Next Steps
1. **Server-Side Validation**: Add additional validation for ontology source parameters in API endpoints
2. **File Extension Configuration**: Consider making file extensions configurable for different ontology types
3. **Improved User Feedback**: Enhance error messages with recovery suggestions when ontology files can't be found
4. **Caching**: Implement caching for frequently used ontology files to improve performance

## May 18, 2025 (Update #39): Fixed Ontology File Path and Client Method Access Issues

### Task Completed
Fixed two critical issues in the Enhanced Ontology MCP Server that were causing errors during guideline concept extraction: a mismatch between the ontology source ID and actual filename, and an ontology client method access issue.

### Key Improvements
1. **Fixed Ontology File Path Mismatch**:
   - Identified that the server was using "engineering-ethics" (with hyphen) as the source ID
   - Corrected this to "engineering_ethics" (with underscore) to match the actual filename
   - This resolved the error where the system couldn't find the ontology file

2. **Implemented OntologyClientWrapper**:
   - Created an OntologyClientWrapper class to safely mediate access between modules and the server
   - Fixed the 'EnhancedOntologyServerWithGuidelines' object has no attribute 'get_ontology_sources' error
   - Provided proper error handling and fallbacks for ontology method access
   - Modified server initialization to use this wrapper for more reliable method access

3. **Testing and Verification**:
   - Created comprehensive tests to verify both fixes
   - Confirmed the system can now properly load the ontology file with 89 triples
   - Verified that the wrapper correctly forwards method calls to the server
   - Added detailed logging to show the success of each fix

### Technical Details
The implementation solves two distinct issues:

1. **File path issue**: There was a naming convention mismatch between the source ID in `get_ontology_sources()` returning "engineering-ethics" and the actual file named "engineering_ethics.ttl". This would cause the file loader to look for a non-existent file.

2. **Method access issue**: When the GuidelineAnalysisModule tried to call `ontology_client.get_ontology_sources()`, the method couldn't be located. The wrapper pattern provides a reliable interface that forwards method calls to the server, with proper error handling.

Both fixes work together to ensure the guideline concept extraction process can properly access the ontology data needed for concept matching and extraction.

### Next Steps
1. **Restart MCP Server**: Restart the MCP server to apply the fixes
2. **Test Complete Workflow**: Test the entire guideline concept extraction process with the fixed implementation
3. **Monitor Production**: Monitor the production system for any related issues
4. **Documentation**: Update technical documentation with details about the ontology client implementation pattern
