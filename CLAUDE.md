## 2025-04-24: Fixed UI Inconsistencies in World Detail Page and API Route References

Fixed inconsistencies in the world detail page UI and updated API route references:

### Changes Made:
1. **Fixed Button Labels in World Detail Page**:
   - Corrected the button label in the World Entities section to show "Edit Entities" instead of incorrectly showing "Edit Ontology"
   - Ensured proper URL parameters are maintained for both buttons to direct to the correct editor views

2. **Updated API Route References**:
   - Fixed document API endpoint references to match the actual implementation:
     - Changed `documents.view_document` to `api_documents.get_document`
     - Changed `documents.edit_document` to `api_documents.update_document`
     - Changed `documents.delete_document` to `api_documents.delete_document`
   - Updated parameter names for route consistency (using `document_id` instead of `doc_id` where needed)

3. **Fixed Template Structure Issues**:
   - Ensured all Jinja template blocks are properly closed
   - Fixed parameter name consistency across URL routes (using `id` instead of `world_id` in some places)
   - Corrected HTML structure to ensure proper rendering

### Previous Issues Fixed:
- Button labeling inconsistency in the World Entities section
- Template rendering errors due to incorrect endpoint references
- Jinja template syntax errors causing 500 responses

### Next Steps:
- Continue improving the ontology editor integration with database storage
- Enhance entity type handling in world detail view
- Add validation for ontology format during upload and editing

## 2025-04-24: Migrated Ontologies to Database Storage and Fixed UI Issues

Implemented a comprehensive database-backed system for ontology storage and management:

### Changes Made:
1. **Created Database Models for Ontology Storage**:
   - Added `Ontology` model to store ontology metadata and content
   - Added `OntologyVersion` model to maintain version history
   - Updated `World` model with a foreign key reference to ontologies

2. **Migration Process**:
   - Created migration script to move ontologies from filesystem to database
   - Preserved backward compatibility with filesystem storage
   - Created database column creation utility for existing databases

3. **UI Improvements**:
   - Fixed label issue where both buttons were saying "Edit Ontology" in the world detail page
   - Updated "Edit Entities" button in the World Entities section 
   - Standardized URL parameter handling for the ontology editor

4. **API Enhancements**:
   - Modified API routes to query database first, then fall back to filesystem
   - Added support for both formats of ontology sources (with and without .ttl extension)
   - Improved error handling and added detailed logging

### Previous Issues Fixed:
- Fixed 404 errors when accessing ontologies via the editor
- Fixed inconsistent button labels in the world detail page
- Addressed metadata inconsistencies between ontology sources and filesystem paths
- Implemented database storage for better reliability and consistency

### Next Steps:
- Complete the transition to database storage by updating entity retrieval
- Implement proper entity editing through the database
- Enhance database queries with joins for better performance
- Add database backup and restore for ontologies

## 2025-04-24: Fixed Ontology Editor URL Handling

Fixed an issue with ontology editor URL handling to properly process ontology sources without .ttl extension:

### Changes Made:
1. **Modified API Routes in `ontology_editor/api/routes.py`**:
   - Added a dedicated route to handle ontology requests without .ttl extension
   - Updated the `get_ontology_by_source` function to properly handle both cases (with/without extension)
   - Improved logging for better debugging
   - Added automatic domain name conversion between dash and underscore formats

2. **Updated World Template**:
   - Modified the world detail template to correctly strip .ttl extensions from ontology sources
   - Fixed "Edit Entities" button label (was incorrectly shown as "Edit Ontology")
   - Updated URL parameter handling to ensure proper routing

### Previous Issues Fixed:
- Fixed 404 error when accessing ontology via API with stripped extension
- Addressed metadata inconsistencies between ontology sources and filesystem paths
- Improved error handling and added more verbose logging

### Next Steps:
- Create database model for ontologies to provide more robust storage
- Implement proper entity type handling in world detail view
- Add validation for ontology format during upload and editing
- Consider implementing a visual ontology editor

## 2025-04-24: Fixed Ontology Editor Integration Issues

Fixed several issues with the ontology editor integration to ensure proper functionality:

### Changes Made:
1. **Fixed 404 Error and URL Issues**:
   - Added proper routes in the ontology editor blueprint to handle direct access to `/ontology-editor`
   - Updated routes to support both full ontology editing and entity-specific editing
   - Configured the blueprint to use the correct templates
