## 2025-04-28 - Fixed MCP Server Port Conflict Issue

### Issue Fixed

Fixed an issue where the ProEthica application failed to start with an `OSError: [Errno 98] address already in use` error on port 5001. This prevented the MCP server from starting properly.

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue occurred because:
1. Multiple scripts were attempting to start different variants of the MCP server
2. The process termination in the restart script was insufficient (only killing specific process patterns)
3. No port availability check was performed before starting the new server
4. Multiple server variants (enhanced_mcp_server.py and http_ontology_mcp_server.py) could run simultaneously on the same port

### Solution Implemented

1. **Enhanced MCP Server Restart Script**
   - Added comprehensive process cleanup for all MCP server variants
   - Implemented port availability checking before starting the server
   - Added lock file mechanism to prevent multiple instances
   
   - Added verification that the server is properly listening on the port

2. **Key Improvements**
   - More robust process detection and termination
   - Multiple detection methods (ps, pkill, lsof, netstat)
   - Explicit verification of port availability
   - Better error messages with troubleshooting guidance
   - Enhanced logging to a dedicated log file

### Benefits

- **More Reliable Startup**: Application startup is now more robust
- **Better Error Handling**: Clear error messages help with troubleshooting
- **Improved Logging**: Comprehensive logs make issue diagnosis easier
- **Process Management**: Better management of MCP server processes
- **Port Conflict Resolution**: Automatic detection and handling of port conflicts

This fix ensures the ProEthica application can start reliably without port conflicts from previously running MCP server instances.

   - Added better handling of reset operations when switching contexts

### Benefits

- **Improved User Experience**: Clearer workflow for selecting ontology contexts
- **Reduced Confusion**: Eliminated the possibility of conflicting selections
- **Better Integration**: Worlds now properly load their associated ontologies automatically
- **Consistent Context**: Ensured ontology entities loaded for a world match the expected ontology
- **Simplified Interface**: Clearer user journey with fewer opportunities for error

### Technical Implementation

The implementation involved changes to both frontend and backend components:

1. In the frontend template (`ontology_agent_window.html`):
   - Added conditional display of the ontology selection dropdown based on world selection
   - Added a readonly display of the associated ontology when a world is selected
   - Added property to store the world's ontology name

2. In the backend route handlers (`ontology_agent.py`):
   - Created a new API endpoint to get ontology details for a world
   - Enhanced world selection logic to reset ontology selection
   - Added proper error handling for missing ontologies

These changes ensure that when a user selects an Engineering World, the engineering-ethics ontology is automatically loaded, making the interface more intuitive and reliable.

## 2025-04-29 - Fixed Claude API Authentication Issue

### Issue Fixed

Fixed an issue where the ontology agent was falling back to mock responses even though `USE_MOCK_FALLBACK` was set to false in the .env file.

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue occurred because:
1. The Anthropic API key in the .env file was invalid or had an incorrect format
2. The key started with `sk-ant-api03-` which might be using an older authentication format
3. When authentication with the Anthropic API failed, the system automatically fell back to mock mode regardless of the `USE_MOCK_FALLBACK` setting

### Solution Implemented

1. **API Key Update**
   - Updated the Anthropic API key in the .env file with a valid one
   - Ensured the API key format was compatible with the current Anthropic API version
   - Verified key functionality using multiple test scripts

2. **Extra Security Measures**
   - Ran git protection script (git_protect_keys.sh) to prevent the API key from being committed to Git
   - Verified that .env is already in .gitignore to prevent accidental exposure
   - Ensured the API key is protected by the git update-index --assume-unchanged mechanism

3. **Verification Process**
   - Confirmed that the API key works using multiple test methods:
     - Comprehensive verification with verify_anthropic_fix.py
     - Basic API test with simple_claude_test.py
     - Successfully listed available Claude models

### Benefits

- **Real API Responses**: The system now uses real responses from Claude's API instead of mock data
- **Better Quality Answers**: Users get accurate, up-to-date responses from the latest Claude models
- **Enhanced Capabilities**: Full access to Claude's capabilities for complex ontology reasoning
- **Maintainable Solution**: Clear documentation of the issue and its solution for future reference
- **Secured Credentials**: API key is protected from accidental exposure in the repository

The fix ensures that the ontology agent can effectively leverage Claude's API for answering queries about ontology entities and relationships, providing more accurate and helpful responses to users.

### Additional Improvements

- **Added Lock Files to GitIgnore**: Updated .gitignore to exclude *.lock files and the tmp/ directory
  - Prevents temporary lock files used by MCP servers from being committed to the repository
  - Avoids potential conflicts when multiple developers work on the same codebase
  - Ensures clean repository without temporary operational files
  - Removed existing lock file from Git cache with `git rm --cached tmp/enhanced_mcp_server.lock` while preserving the file itself
