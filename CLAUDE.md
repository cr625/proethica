## 2025-05-19: Ontology Enhancements

Updated the proethica-intermediate.ttl ontology with the following:

1. Enhanced temporal modeling aligned with Basic Formal Ontology (BFO):
   - Properly aligned temporal classes with BFO temporal region classes (BFO_0000038, BFO_0000148)
   - Improved temporal relation properties with appropriate domain and range constraints
   - Added temporal granularity concepts with proper BFO subclassing

2. Added decision timeline concepts:
   - Decision timeline classes for representing sequences of decisions and consequences
   - Alternative timeline classes for modeling hypothetical decision scenarios
   - Relations for connecting decisions to their temporal contexts and consequences

3. Enhanced ethical context modeling:
   - Added EthicalContext class with proper BFO alignment
   - Added properties to represent ethical weights and relationships
   - Created ethical agent concepts to represent decision makers

All ontology updates are properly aligned with BFO, using appropriate parent classes:
- Temporal entities are subclasses of BFO temporal region classes
- Material entities are properly aligned with BFO independent continuant hierarchy
- Properties have appropriate domain and range restrictions aligned with BFO types

The enhanced ontology provides improved representation capabilities for:
- Temporal aspects of ethical decision making
- Hypothetical reasoning about alternative decisions
- Contextual factors in ethical judgments

Next steps:
1. Test the enhanced ontology with existing ProEthica case data
2. Integrate with the temporal context service enhancements
3. Update the entity triple service to leverage new ontology concepts
