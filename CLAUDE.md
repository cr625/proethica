## 5/11/2025 - Case Detail Page Show More Button Fix

### Issue
The case detail page had a JavaScript error: `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'addEventListener')`. This occurred on the "Show More" link that was supposed to expand the case description when clicked.

### Analysis
The error occurred because the JavaScript was trying to add an event listener to the "Show More" button, but in some cases, the elements might not exist in the DOM (e.g., when there are no triple labels).

### Solution
Instead of trying to fix just the JavaScript error, we opted for a more user-friendly approach - removing the truncation feature entirely so the full case description is always displayed by default. This eliminates the need for the "Show More" button and simplifies the user experience.

Changes made:
1. Removed the truncation CSS class from the description container
2. Removed the gradient overlay that was used to indicate truncated content
3. Removed the "Show More" button element 
4. Removed the related JavaScript for toggling the description visibility
5. Updated variable references to prevent null reference errors

### Results
The case details now display fully by default without requiring the user to click a "Show More" button. This creates a more straightforward user experience and eliminates the JavaScript error that was occurring.

### Future Considerations
If the case descriptions become very long, we might want to consider alternative approaches like:
1. Implementing a collapsible accordion style for different sections
2. Using tabs to organize different parts of large cases
3. Adding anchor links to jump to different sections of the case

For now, the full display approach is cleaner and simpler for users.

## 5/11/2025 - Case Title and Ontology Integration Improvements

### Issues Addressed
1. Many cases had generic titles (like "I.3") instead of descriptive titles from the original sources
2. Ontology-related information wasn't displayed properly in the case detail view
3. There was no way to see how principles from the ontology apply to specific case facts

### Solution

#### 1. Case Title Improvement
Created a new script `scripts/fix_case_titles.py` that:
- Identifies cases where the title is just a code number or very short
- Attempts to fetch the proper title from the source website
- If that fails, constructs a title from the URL path segments
- Updates the database with more descriptive titles

For example, case #166 will now show "Public Safety, Health & Welfare: Avoiding Rolling Blackouts" instead of just "I.3."

#### 2. Ontology Integration Display
Created a new script `scripts/enhanced_ontology_display.py` that:
- Processes entity triples for each case
- Extracts principle instantiations (connections between principles and facts)
- Adds this information to the case metadata for display

#### 3. Case Detail View Enhancement
Updated the case detail template to:
- Display principles identified in the case as badges
- Show a table of principle instantiations that connect principles to specific facts
- Present this information in an "Ontology Integration" section

### Results
These changes create a more comprehensive and informative case detail view that:
1. Has more descriptive case titles that reflect the actual content
2. Shows how the ontology principles relate to the specific case
3. Makes the connections between principles and facts explicit

### Future Work
1. Further enhance the triple extraction and principle identification
2. Add interactive filtering of entities by principle
3. Implement visualization of principle conflicts
## Case Detail View Enhancement - 2025-05-11

### Changes Implemented
1. **Fixed JavaScript Error**: Removed problematic "Show More" link and associated code that was causing the `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading addEventListener)` error
2. **Enhanced Case Display**: Updated the case detail template to include a new "Ontology Integration" section that displays principles and their instantiations
3. **Created Support Scripts**:
   - `scripts/fix_case_titles.py`: Improves case titles by converting code references to descriptive titles
   - `scripts/enhanced_ontology_display.py`: Processes entity triples to extract principle information and add it to case metadata for display

### Verification Steps
1. **Backed up database**: Created backup `ai_ethical_dm_backup_20250511_165244.dump`
2. **Committed code changes**: Added the template modifications and new scripts to git
3. **Ran enhanced_ontology_display.py**: Script executed successfully but found 0 cases with entity triples

### Next Steps for Full Ontology Integration
1. **Populate Entity Triples**: Cases need entity triples to be created first before the ontology integration display will show relevant information
2. **Run McLaren Case Analysis**: Use `mclaren_case_analysis_module.py` to analyze cases and generate entity triples
3. **Re-run Enhancement Script**: Once triples exist, run `enhanced_ontology_display.py` again to update metadata
4. **Test Display**: Verify the case detail page shows principles and their instantiations properly

The infrastructure for displaying ontology integration is now in place, but requires entity triple data to be populated first.
