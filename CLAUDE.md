# ProEthica and REALM Development Log

## May 11, 2025 - Database Schema Initialization and Error Resolution

### Issue Resolved: Database Table Creation

**Problem:** ProEthica was encountering database errors when accessing routes like `/scenarios/` and `/worlds/`. The error logs showed that the database tables like `scenarios` and `worlds` did not exist.

**Solution:**
1. Created a database initialization script (`scripts/initialize_proethica_db.py`) that:
   - Sets up the proper database connection
   - Creates all necessary database tables for the application
   - Verifies the tables have been created correctly
   
2. Updated the startup script (`start_proethica_updated.sh`) to:
   - Run the database initialization script during startup
   - Improve error handling for the database connection string
   - Properly clean up and restart MCP server processes

**Results:**
- The routes `/scenarios/`, `/worlds/`, and `/cases/` now work correctly
- The database tables are properly created
- The MCP server starts up correctly and is accessible

**Technical Notes:**
- The database URI was being incorrectly parsed due to escaped characters in earlier implementation
- Setting the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable directly in the initialization script fixed this issue
- The database schema is now initialized before the application starts

## REALM Project Overview and Integration Plan

### REALM - Materials Science Ontology Integration

REALM (Resource for Engineering and Advanced Learning in Materials) is a new application being developed to integrate with the Materials Science and Engineering Ontology (MSEO) from [matportal.org/ontologies/MSEO](https://matportal.org/ontologies/MSEO).

**Current Components:**
- Created directory structure for REALM application
- Implemented MCP server integration for MSEO ontology
- Set up shared database infrastructure with ProEthica

**Integration Strategy:**
- REALM will use shared components from the agent_module
- The ontology MCP server will be extended for both applications
- Common database infrastructure will be used but with separate schemas

**Next Steps:**
1. Complete the MSEO ontology integration with the MCP server
2. Implement the REALM-specific UI components
3. Extend the ontology editor for materials science concepts
