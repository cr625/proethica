2025-04-28 - Fixed MCP Server Port Conflict Issue

### Issue Fixed

Fixed an issue where the ProEthica application failed to start with an `OSError: [Errno 98] address already in use` error on port 5001. This prevented the MCP server from starting properly.

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue occurred because:
1. Multiple scripts were attempting to start different variants of the MCP server
2. The process termination in the restart script was insufficient (only killing specific process patterns)
3. No port availability check was performed before starting the new server
4. Multiple server variants (enhanced_mcp_server.py and http_ontology_mcp_server.py) could run simultaneously on the same port

### Solution Implemented

1. **Enhanced MCP Server Restart Script**
   - Added comprehensive process cleanup for all MCP server variants
   - Implemented port availability checking before starting the server
   - Added lock file mechanism to prevent multiple instances

   - Added verification that the server is properly listening on the port

2. **Key Improvements**
   - More robust process detection and termination
   - Multiple detection methods (ps, pkill, lsof, netstat)
   - Explicit verification of port availability
   - Better error messages with troubleshooting guidance
   - Enhanced logging to a dedicated log file

### Benefits

- **More Reliable Startup**: Application startup is now more robust
- **Better Error Handling**: Clear error messages help with troubleshooting
- **Improved Logging**: Comprehensive logs make issue diagnosis easier
- **Process Management**: Better management of MCP server processes
- **Port Conflict Resolution**: Automatic detection and handling of port conflicts

This fix ensures the ProEthica application can start reliably without port conflicts from previously running MCP server instances.

## 2025-04-29 - Implemented Environment-Aware Configuration System

### Actions Taken

1. **Created Environment Configuration Framework**
   - Developed a robust, environment-aware configuration system in `config/`
   - Created separate configuration files for development and production environments
   - Implemented automatic environment detection based on ENVIRONMENT variable
   - Added comprehensive logging and error handling for configuration loading

## 2025-04-29 - Unified Environment Support System

### Actions Taken

1. **Implemented Unified Environment Detection**
   - Enhanced environment detection in `config/environment.py` to automatically detect:
     - GitHub Codespaces environment (via CODESPACES environment variable)
     - WSL environment (by examining /proc/version)
     - Explicitly configured environment (via ENVIRONMENT variable)
     - Default environment based on hostname and git branch

2. **Created Environment-Specific Configuration Files**
   - Added `config/environments/wsl.py` for WSL-specific settings
   - Added `config/environments/codespace.py` for GitHub Codespaces-specific settings
   - Maintained existing `development.py` and `production.py` configurations

3. **Enhanced Startup Scripts**
   - Modified `auto_run.sh` to handle all environment types automatically
   - Updated `start_proethica.sh` to provide environment-specific setup steps
   - Consolidated environment-specific logic in one codebase

4. **Added Documentation**
   - Created `docs/unified_environment_system.md` explaining the new system
   - Documented the implementation and benefits in detail

### Benefits

- **Branch Consolidation**: Eliminated need for separate environment branches
- **Simplified Git Workflow**: One development branch for all environments (WSL, Codespaces, etc.)
- **Reduced Merge Conflicts**: No need to sync changes between environment branches
- **Improved Developer Experience**: Environment is auto-detected, no manual configuration needed
- **Cleaner Version History**: Git history follows feature development, not environment tweaks

### How It Works

The system uses a priority-based detection mechanism:
1. First checks for GitHub Codespaces environment
2. Then checks for WSL environment
3. Falls back to explicit environment setting or inference from hostname/branch

This allows the code to automatically adapt to whatever environment it's running in, while 
maintaining environment-specific optimizations for database connections, paths, and other 
configuration details.
