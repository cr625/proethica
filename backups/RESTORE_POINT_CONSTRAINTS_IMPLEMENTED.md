# Database Restore Point: Constraints Implemented

**Date**: August 6, 2025  
**Time**: 17:41:49 UTC  
**Backup File**: `ai_ethical_dm_backup_CONSTRAINTS_IMPLEMENTED_20250806_174149.dump`  
**Size**: 1.2M

## ðŸŽ‰ Milestone: Constraints Added as 9th GuidelineConceptType

### What was implemented:
1. **Added Constraint GuidelineConceptType** to `proethica-intermediate.ttl`
2. **Added 8 Constraint entities** to `engineering-ethics.ttl`:
   - Professional License Constraint
   - Experience Level Constraint  
   - Budget Limit Constraint
   - Time Deadline Constraint
   - Safety Standard Compliance Constraint
   - Conflict of Interest Constraint
   - Supervision Constraint
   - Interdisciplinary Coordination Constraint
3. **Reclassified existing entity**: Moved "Interdisciplinary Coordination Requirement" from Obligations to Constraints
4. **Updated extraction logic** to handle Constraints properly
5. **Synced database** with updated ontology files

### System State:
- **Entity Types**: 9 (up from 8)
- **Total Entities**: 47 (up from 40)
- **Obligations**: 3 entities (down from 4)
- **Constraints**: 8 entities (new category)

### Verification Results:
- âœ… Constraints successfully extracted  
- âœ… 9 GuidelineConceptTypes working
- âœ… No entity overlaps
- âœ… Proper conceptual separation between Obligations and Constraints
- âœ… Ready for rules engine implementation

### Files Modified:
- `ontologies/proethica-intermediate.ttl` - Added Constraint GuidelineConceptType
- `ontologies/engineering-ethics.ttl` - Added 8 constraint entities, removed old requirement
- `app/services/ontology_entity_service.py` - Updated extraction logic

### Ontology Versions:
- proethica-intermediate: Version 5
- engineering-ethics: Version 37

## How to Restore:
```bash
# From project root
./backups/restore_database.sh ai_ethical_dm_backup_CONSTRAINTS_IMPLEMENTED_20250806_174149.dump
```

## Next Steps:
1. Restart web server to see Constraints tab in UI
2. Build rules engine on top of constraint framework
3. Implement rule-based ethical case analysis

This backup represents a major milestone in the ethical reasoning system architecture.
