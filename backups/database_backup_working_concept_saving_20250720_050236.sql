1	2	facts	facts	\N	The Board of Licensure for Professional Engineers (“the PE Board”) in State X consists of six professional engineers and a public member. The governor of State X has recently appointed two new board members, Engineer A and Engineer B, to fill two expiring terms. Engineer A otherwise is a member of the board of directors of a membership engineering organization in that state. Engineer B serves as a committee chair of a national engineering organization. At the first meeting of the newly constituted PE Board, the public member asks whether these outside professional activities constitute a conflict of interest with respect to PE Board service. Engineer A responds that (1) although her state organization has been advocating for the improvement of the state’s continuing professional development requirements to the PE Board and the legislature, (2) she has not been making those presentations, but (3) that the advocacy has been discussed at meetings of the state organization’s board of directors. Engineer B responds that he is the chair of an engineering education committee of the national engineering organization, with a role, in part, to recommend changes to his engineering discipline’s engineering education accreditation criteria, for subsequent review and approval by ABET. The PE Board begins to discuss these professional involvements.

4	2	discussion	discussion	\N	<p>Professional engineers often find themselves involved with and representing multiple organizational interests in their professional activities, and this can give rise to organizational conflicts of interest. Conflicts of interest are among the most prevalent ethical concerns facing engineering practitioners. Over the years, the Board of Ethical Review has considered numerous cases involving engineers who have interests in conflict with the interests of clients, employees, or other engineers. At one time, the NSPE Code of Ethics specifically prohibited engineers from becoming involved in cases or situations in which a conflict of interest was present. This was based on the view that professional engineers must at all times be above reproach and avoid any situation that could be perceived as compromising their professional judgment and integrity as independent professionals.</p>\n<p>Over time, the NSPE Code and the Board of Ethical Review have moderated to the point of recognizing that certain types of conflicts of interest are difficult, if not impossible, to avoid and that the more realistic approach for individual engineers faced with this dilemma is to fully disclose the nature and extent of the conflict to the appropriate parties involved or impacted by the conflict. This is based on the view that the parties most affected by the conflict and who have the most at stake (e.g., clients, employers, other engineering firms, etc.) are in the best position to determine whether their interests will be compromised by the conflict. While sometimes perceived conflicts of interest are resolved by the parties as a result of full disclosure, in other instances the conflicts are deeper and require the engineer to disassociate from a specific project.</p>\n<p>Previous Board of Ethical Review cases provide some background for considering this case. In <a href="https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/conflict-interest-chairman-editorial" target="_blank">BER Case No. 18-2</a>, an engineer was a board member of an engineering technical society and was actively encouraging the society to enter into an agreement with Jones Publishing, a technical journal publisher, to annually publish technical articles and content generated by the society’s members. During meetings of the engineering technical society’s board of directors, the engineer expressed strong resistance to exploring other publishing options to determine what terms and conditions other technical journal publishers might offer to the society. Under a separate private, undisclosed side agreement with Jones Publishing, the engineer was to receive a visible and prestigious position as chairman of the editorial board for another journal published by Jones Publishing if the engineering technical society agreed to enter into the agreement with the company.</p>\n<p>In this case, the BER stated the engineer had a trust relationship in his role as a board member of the engineering technical society and, therefore, must provide full disclosure regarding the side agreement with Jones Publishing to become chairman of the editorial board prior to the engineering society’s formal consideration and voting on the matter. The BER believes that conflicts of interest do not necessarily involve only financial considerations, and organizational conflicts can also be significant. In the BER’s view, the engineer also should have recused himself from his role as a board member acting on this issue for the engineering technical society or, if appropriate, resigned as a board member of the engineering technical society.</p>\n<p>A second example is <a href="https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/conflict-interest-member-legislature" target="_blank">BER Case No. 70-6</a>. Here, as a member of a state legislature, Engineer A is on a committee that initially makes appropriations to local communities for certain public works projects. He is also a partner in an engineering firm in the state. Following an appropriation to local communities in the state for projects designed to combat air pollution as recommended by the legislative committee of which Engineer A is a member, the firm of which Engineer A is a member submits its qualifications for a project to be financed by an appropriation from the legislature. At the meeting of the town council in the town in which the firm of Engineer A is located, objection is voiced to the selection of the firm in which Engineer A is a partner because of his influential position in securing the appropriation.</p>\n<p>In finding that the firm in which Engineer A is a partner may ethically perform engineering services financed by an appropriation secured in part by the position of Engineer A in the legislature, the Board noted that actual awards to the selected engineering firms were to be made by the governing bodies of the local communities. But Engineer A was not a member of the town council, and the facts do not indicate Engineer A used his political office as a means to enhance the opportunities for his firm to benefit from the legislative action.</p>\n<p>A third example is <a href="https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/conflict-interest-membership-public" target="_blank">BER Case No. 75-7</a>. In this case, John Doe, a civil engineer in private practice, is engaged principally in topographical survey work and the design of water and sewer facilities. He is an appointed member of a commission that controls and determines the issuance of water and sewer connection permits to private owners and developers. The commission’s authority is of such a nature that its decisions have a decisive impact on land development projects and the construction of facilities of all kinds by private owners. While serving on the commission, Doe performed extensive topographic survey work and designed the water and sewer systems for a new private facility that had earlier received approval for necessary water and sewer connections from the commission while he was a member of the commission. In response to public criticism for an alleged conflict of interest on his part, Doe noted that he had abstained from the discussion and vote on the permit application.</p>\n<p>Based on the fact that Doe was aware of a potential conflict of interest and he abstained from the discussion and vote, and that it was not established that Doe had influenced the decision on the permit, the Board concluded it was ethical for Doe to perform the engineering and topographic survey work for a private client while serving on the commission when the water and sewer permits were issued. However, the Board did publish a dissenting view that advocated that Doe’s involvement was simply too close and he should resign from the commission.</p>\n<p>Turning to the facts in this case, the BER believes that Engineer A should not be part of any discussion where she is advocating for the improvement of the state’s continuing professional development requirements to the PE Board and legislature. In this manner, her situation most closely parallels that of <a href="https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/conflict-interest-membership-public" target="_blank">Case No. 75-7</a>.</p>\n<p>In many states, the legislature establishes the law for continuing education requirements and the PE Board enforces that law and establishes the rules. PE Board members typically take an oath to uphold the US and State Constitutions, and to abide by the law established by the state legislature and the rules and regulations adopted by the PE Board. Members of the board of directors of an engineering professional organization typically take an oath to represent the interests of member professionals. If the member professional organization is advocating engineering issues before the legislature or the PE Board, a PE Board member who also serves on the board of the member organization would face a direct conflict. Even absent such direct advocacy, membership on both boards may still present the appearance of a conflict of interest to some members of the public. Membership in engineering professional organizations presents no such conflicts of interest, as engagement in engineering and professional issues is of benefit to PE Board members.</p>\n<p>The BER believes that Engineer A has a conflict of interest and that she should resign as a member of the board of directors of her engineering organization if she desires to serve on her state PE board. In the words of <a href="https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/conflict-interest-membership-public" target="_blank">Case 75-7</a>, her involvement “is simply too close.”</p>\n<p>The BER believes that Engineer B’s situation is completely different. Engineer B is the chair of an engineering committee of a national engineering organization, where he recommends changes to his engineering discipline’s engineering education accreditation criteria for ABET. Thus, the situation of Engineer B more closely approximates that described in <a href="https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/conflict-interest-member-legislature" target="_blank">Case No. 70-6</a>. The BER does not believe that this is a conflict of interest because individual state PE boards have no jurisdiction over ABET’s engineering education criteria. All engineering disciplines have a society that is responsible for establishing discipline-specific program criteria. State licensing board members have nothing to do with ABET’s discipline-specific criteria.

6	2	dissenting_opinion	dissenting_opinion	\N	<p><strong>DISSENTING OPINION (AS TO ENGINEER A ONLY)</strong><br/>\n\tOne description of a conflict of interest is a situation in which an individual has competing interests or loyalties. Martin and Schinzinger, in their text, <em>Ethics in Engineering</em><a href="https://www.nspe.org#section1" target="_blank"><span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller;">1</span></a>, state: We can refine our definition of conflict of interest when two conditions are met:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n\t\tThe professional is in a relationship or role that requires exercising good judgment on behalf of the interests of an employer or client.</li>\n<li>\n\t\tThe professional has some additional or side interest that could threaten good judgment in serving the interests of the employer or client—either the good judgment of that professional or the judgment of a typical professional in that situation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the case of Engineer A, service on both boards requires exercising good judgment; the first condition for a conflict of interest is met. When serving on the PE Board, the discussion of this case established that the ultimate client is the public. Similarly, a fundamental canon of the NSPE Code of Ethics states that in the performance of their professional duties, engineers shall hold paramount the public health, safety, and welfare. Engineer A’s service on both boards is in the interest of the public and judgment will be exercised on the public’s behalf.</p>\n<p>Further, NSPE’s Code of Ethics indicates that an engineer’s professional obligations include striving to serve the public interest; listed activities include service in civic affairs and continued professional development throughout one’s career. These obligations do not fall solely to board members of professional engineering organizations—they apply to all engineers. Advocacy for development and maintenance of professional competence is not an additional or side interest that threatens Engineer A’s good judgment; it is an integral part of Engineer A’s obligation as an engineer.

7	4	facts	facts	\N	Engineer T, a senior structural engineer who designs commercial buildings in the employ of XYZ Consulting Engineers, was in responsible charge of the design of major structural modifications to an existing building. In establishing the project scope for the structural modifications, Engineer T selected a straightforward approach that required making structural connections immediately beneath floor level on an upper floor, in a tightly constrained space. Engineer T proceeded with the project per these parameters and did not explore alternative design approaches. Rather, Engineer T completed the design within the identified constraints and issued construction documents for the modifications.The new structural connections were located in such a way that access was limited, and the drawings clearly noted the constrained access. This design detail required the construction workers to make the connections in a contorted fashion. During construction, an accident occurred with a serious and permanent injury to a construction worker. Following the accident, Engineer T revisited the site and realized that had alternative design concepts been explored early on, the new structural modifications could have been proposed in a fundamentally different, more complex, but functionally equivalent way. The alternative approach would have been more costly and taken more time, but it would have allowed the construction workers to make all connections while standing on the floor such that injury would have been far less likely. Engineer T felt some personal responsibility for the accident.Engineer T met with XYZ’s Chief Structural Engineer, Engineer B, explained the situation, and expressed a belief that a design error – i.e., not exploring alternative, safer design concepts – had been made and the NSPE Code of Ethics required that the error be acknowledged. Engineer B responded that Engineer T and XYZ Consulting Engineers had responded professionally to the design project, they had recommended a straightforward structural modification approach, and they were not expected or asked to consider alternative concepts. Further, Engineer T had specifically identified the constrained area of the new connections in the design documents, but because T was not trained in construction safety either by education (since civil engineering education typically does not include construction safety) or by specific experience (working for a construction contractor), Engineer T could not have reasonably known or assessed the level of worker safety risk posed by the connection location. The contractor had not raised questions regarding the construction safety risk or safer construction alternatives. Having thus thoughtfully considered the matter, both Engineer T and Engineer B decided that the situation did not merit acknowledgement of “an error.”Months later, after a construction claim had been submitted and a lawsuit had been filed, Engineer T met with attorneys representing XYZ and XYZ’s insurance company to prepare for a deposition of Engineer T. During preparation, Engineer T reviewed and discussed the project history, including the conversation with Engineer B relative to T’s feeling there was, potentially, a professional obligation to acknowledge an error – i.e., not exploring alternative, safer design concepts. Both of XYZ Consulting Engineers’ attorneys agreed that a clear obligation existed not to distort or alter any facts, and that Engineer T should respond to questions with complete transparency during the deposition. They pointed out, however, that whether an error was made was not up to Engineer T and was not clear in this set of circumstances, including for the reasons that Engineer B had indicated to Engineer T earlier. They also pointed out that one of the purposes of the legal process was to determine what errors might have been made and by whom, and what impact such errors might have had on the accident. The attorneys indicated that the legal process would determine whether, based on the facts, an error had been made, and that Engineer T should clearly report the facts, but should not voluntarily characterize the design work as an error.In the deposition, Engineer T responded factually to all questions regarding the design and the design process. Engineer T was not asked if an error had been made and did not offer an acknowledgement of a possible error.

9	4	conclusion	conclusion	\N	It was ethical for Engineer T and Engineer B to conclude no error had been made in design, based on review and analysis of the facts from both from a legal/contractual perspective and from an ethical perspective. Engineer T’s design approach represented professional practice consistent with the standard of care.It was ethical for Engineer T not to acknowledge an error after the accident occurred because there was no error. However, based on hindsight, other ways to approach the project may have prevented the accident and worker injury, and this was a missed opportunity to hold paramount the public safety, health, and welfare. Engineer T is encouraged to share this hard “lesson learned” as part of continued professional development.It was ethical for Engineer T to refrain from acknowledging an error during the deposition because there was no error. Engineer T should respond clearly and honestly when questioned about the project, including views on alternative design approaches vis-à-vis the public safety, health, and welfare, but should not characterize the work as a design error.

10	4	discussion	discussion	\N	<p>This case addresses two ethical issues in engineering practice: to what extent are design engineers obligated to account for construction safety risks in their designs if they are not trained or have experience in construction safety methods, and are engineers obligated by the NSPE Code of Ethics to “acknowledge errors” when it is not clear an error has been made.</p><p>The first issue, having to do with considering construction safety risks in the design, can be approached from both a legal/contractual (i.e., risk management) perspective and from an ethical perspective. On the legal/contractual side, many professional engineers familiar with construction contracts believe contract language sufficiently settles the matter. They point to standard construction contract provisions such as, “Contractor shall be solely responsible for the means, methods, techniques, sequences, and procedures of construction” (Engineers Joint Contract Documents Committee [EJCDC], C-700, Standard General Conditions of the Construction Contract, Article 7, Paragraph 7.01A). The construction contracts also include provisions identifying the Contractor’s sole responsibility for initiating, maintaining, and supervising all safety programs and precautions (Article 7, Paragraph 7.13A), for obtaining additional services as needed to carry out Contractor’s safety responsibilities (Article 7, Paragraph 7.01B), and for taking necessary precautions for safety and providing necessary protection to prevent damage, injury, or loss to all persons on the site who may be affected by the work (Article 7, Paragraph 7.13C). Through these legal/contractual mechanisms, risk and responsibility for worker safety during construction are formally transferred to the contractor, the contractor being the party best positioned to provide for project safety.  By this view, and with reference to the present case, the contractor is solely responsible for project safety, so Engineer T did not make any design error so long as the design met the professional standard of care (which the facts suggest it did).</p><p>But engineers must also consider the ethical perspective, and that is the primary area of concern for the Board of Ethical Review. Ethically, the facts of this case reveal a tension between the engineer doing what is professionally required, versus ”going above and beyond” in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare. The Board has considered this ethical tension in various ways over the years.</p><p><a href="https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/duty-report-unrelated-information" target="_blank">BER Case 97-13</a> introduces Engineer A, a civil engineer, who serves as a subconsultant to perform bridge inspection services on a major bridge overhaul project. Engineer A’s scope of work is solely to identify any pavement damage on the bridge and report the damage to its client, VWX Architects. While conducting the bridge inspection, and although not part of the scope of services for which he was retained, Engineer A notices an apparent pre-existing defective condition in a retaining wall which failed to restrain a vehicle, leading to a fatal accident involving Police Officer B. Engineer A surmises that the defective condition may have been a contributing factor in the wall failure and notes this in the engineering notes. Engineer A verbally reports this information to the client, which then verbally reports the information to the public agency. In finding it was ethical for Engineer A to retain the information in the engineering notes, but not include it in the final written report, the Board noted that Engineer A did the appropriate thing in coming forward to the client with the information and also by documenting the information for possible future reference as appropriate. But under the circumstances “it would have been improper for Engineer A to include reference to the information in his final report, particularly since it would have been based upon mere speculation and not careful testing or evaluation by a competent individual or firm.” In fact, the Board opined that had Engineer A formally “reported” the matter publicly, it would have been “an overreaction and could easily have risked jeopardizing the professional reputations of [Engineer A’s] client and the public agency.” The key finding from <span class="case-reference">Case 97-13</span> is that the public welfare was best served by Engineer A exercising restraint in reporting. This parallels the current case, where Engineer A identified a safety risk in the design details, but per customary professional practice relied on the contractor (who had specific construction safety expertise) to address the issue. </p><p>A second example is <a href="https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/public-health-safety-and-welfare-4" target="_blank">BER Case 21-2</a>, where a second Engineer A serves as a consulting engineer representing Client B, a developer who is proposing to develop a healthcare facility that requires a significant upgrade to the property’s access road that crosses a tidal saltmarsh. Engineer A’s scope includes design and local permitting of the roadway, including an upgrade of the tidal crossing from a small culvert to a small bridge, increasing its hydraulic capacity. The local development regulations and national design codes and standards have not yet been updated to reflect changing conditions and weather patterns, including effects of sea level rise and changes in precipitation intensities and recurrence intervals effected by on-going climate change. It is Engineer A’s judgment, based on hydraulic evaluation procedures presented at a recent transportation agency conference, that the proposed project may result in some upstream homes becoming uninhabitable a decade or more earlier than would otherwise be the case. Engineer A proposes a complex and costly hydrologic and hydraulic analysis by a specialized subconsultant to predict the extent to which sea level rise and the increased hydraulic capacity of the tidal crossing will result in flood damage to a neighborhood of twenty upstream homes during future high tides and storm surges, anticipating this to be a difficult question to answer in the project’s public hearings. Client B directs Engineer A to proceed without the costly analysis unless and until such an analysis is requested by the applicable regulatory authorities. In this case, the BER found that “if Engineer A is reasonably certain that the project will result in adverse impacts to public health, safety, and welfare, and if the Client B denies the requisite evaluation, Engineer A should include the concern regarding potential adverse public health, safety, and welfare impacts in an engineering report for consideration by regulatory agencies and the public.” Thus, the key finding from <span class="case-reference">Case 21-2</span> is that the public welfare was best served by Engineer A reporting the public health, safety, and welfare concerns, even if the client did not wish for this to be done. This differs from the current case, not because public health, safety, and welfare is somehow less important now than in <span class="case-reference">Case 21-2</span>, but because a project delivery process exists in this case by which it was accepted professional practice for Engineer A to complete the structural design, and rely on the contractor to handle safety aspects of construction. The Engineer A from <span class="case-reference">Case 21-2</span> did not have this option.</p><p>Finally, there is <a href="https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/professional-competence-current" target="_blank">BER Case 02-5</a> where a third Engineer A, a structural engineer with experience in the design of structures in the region in which the current project is located, designed a structural system that Engineer A believed was sound and met applicable codes. However, new and improved design methods had recently been suggested in an article published in a technical journal, addressing new information regarding severe weather design in that region. Engineer A had not read that technical journal article. Within a year following construction, the building was damaged by severe weather conditions. It was determined that had the methods suggested in the technical articles been utilized in design, the damage would not have occurred. The BER concluded that it was not unethical for Engineer A to fail to follow methods suggested in a recent technical journal article that Engineer A had not reviewed. The BER indicated that they believed that the definition of what is “current practice” must be discerning and reasonable. The key finding from <span class="case-reference">Case 02-5</span> was that engineers cannot be expected (obligated) to incorporate each and every new, innovative technique until such techniques are incorporated into generally accepted practice and become standards that should be followed. Engineer T (in the current case) and Engineer A (<span class="case-reference">Case 02-5</span>) both followed accepted standard design practice. But these same engineers also had the opportunity (not obligation) to take the public welfare more firmly into account, to go above and beyond what was legally and ethically required. While they cannot be ethically faulted for not “going the extra mile” for the sake of the public health, safety, and welfare, the project outcomes likely would have been better if these engineers had done so. In hindsight, knowing the outcomes, the BER believes all parties would have wanted to at least consider the opportunity.</p><p>Collectively, the prior BER Cases reveal several principles to guide the engineer relative to the ethics of the situation. First, the engineer must hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public. Second, engineers must be competent in their areas of service. Third, engineers must be honest, and issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner. Fourth, the engineer must acknowledge their errors and not distort or alter the facts. These ethical obligations are required, and non-negotiable. So it is within this context that the engineer must determine how best to satisfy their obligations. The facts of the present case do not raise concerns about Engineer T’s competence in performing structural engineering design work. Further, Engineer T’s structural modification approach appears to have been straightforward, professionally designed, and properly presented in the construction documents. Not only this, but the design specifically mentions that the new structural connections were located in such a way that access was limited. These points demonstrate proper awareness and consideration of public safety, health, and welfare. When the design was completed, the facts imply Engineer T relied on the contractor to provide for worker safety during construction, and formally transferred this risk and responsibility via standard contractual language. Further, the facts indicate the contractor accepted the construction risk and responsibility without any question. On this basis, the facts do not suggest Engineer T made a design error. As with Engineer A in <span class="case-reference">Case 97-13</span>, the fact that Engineer T (this present case) noticed after the accident that an alternative design approach could have prevented the worker injury does not mean that Engineer T was required to report this as an error.</p><p>But the question remains – similar to <span class="case-reference">Case 21-2</span> and <span class="case-reference">Case 02-5</span> – whether Engineer T did all that could have been done for worker safety? After all, the solution approach Engineer T followed for this project did include an unusual and challenging construction aspect. Was it enough simply to call attention to this and shift safety responsibility to the contractor? <span class="case-reference">Case 21-2</span> suggests it would have been ethically appropriate (an opportunity, not an obligation) for Engineer T to identify not just the straightforward design alternative, but also the more involved structural modification concept, to identify and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of both options, and to place these matters before the client and other members of the design team, possibly including the contractor, early in the process. Another option would have been for Engineer T to request a constructability review, or an independent construction safety review, or to inquire whether the contractor’s construction safety plan had flagged the heightened safety risk. If so, perhaps the issue would have been raised and alternatives might have been addressed. But Engineer T did not actively seek this input, and perhaps that is why Engineer T “felt some personal responsibility for the accident.”</p><p>But was this an “error?” Did Engineer T and/or Engineer B deviate from ethical engineering practice under the facts? The BER affirms the “ethical high road” of considering more than one design approach, and certainly the BER would agree with seeking critical input from construction safety professionals. But as in <span class="case-reference">Case 02-5</span>, the BER does not view Engineer T’s design as unethical. While the construction accident and worker injury are tragic outcomes, because Engineer T’s design approach represented professional practice consistent with the standard of care, the BER sees this more as a missed opportunity than an ethical lapse and concludes that no “error” was made in design.</p><p>Was it ethical for Engineer T not to acknowledge an error after the accident occurred? The facts of this case and especially the discussion between Engineer T and Engineer B, as well as the legal/contractual perspective and ethical considerations outlined above, provide a rationale as to why Engineer T’s design was not an “error.” Because there was no error, Engineer T was not ethically obligated to acknowledge an error after the accident occurred. However, the BER believes this project was a missed opportunity for Engineer T to more fully and carefully hold paramount the public safety, health, and welfare.</p><p>The BER believes Engineer T should state that while no error was made, based on hindsight, other ways to approach the project existed which may have prevented the accident and worker injury. The view is consistent with ethics provisions that require engineers to be objective and truthful in professional reports, statements, or testimony; that engineers include all relevant and pertinent information, that they not distort or alter the facts, and avoid the use of statements containing a material misrepresentation of fact or omitting a material fact; and that they accept personal responsibility for their professional activities. Such conversation will not only allow Engineer T’s firm and others to benefit from lessons learned through this very difficult experience but will also promote continued professional development relative to projects of this type.  </p><p>Was it ethical for Engineer T not to acknowledge an error during the deposition? Again, using the same analysis presented above, the BER concludes that Engineer T’s design was not an “error.” Because there was no error, Engineer T was not ethically obligated to acknowledge an error during the deposition. Engineer T should respond clearly and honestly when questioned about the project, including T’s views on alternative design approaches vis-à-vis the public safety, health, and welfare, but should not characterize the work as a design

The governor of State X has recently appointed two new board members, Engineer A and Engineer B, to fill two expiring terms. Engineer A otherwise is a member of the board of directors of a membership engineering organization in that state. Engineer B serves as a committee chair of a national engineering organization. At the first meeting of the newly constituted PE Board, the public member asks whether these outside professional activities constitute a conflict of interest with respect to PE Board service. Engineer A responds that (1) although her state organization has been advocating for the improvement of the state’s continuing professional development requirements to the PE Board and the legislature, (2) she has not been making those presentations, but (3) that the advocacy has been discussed at meetings of the state organization’s board of directors. Engineer B responds that he is the chair of an engineering education committee of the national engineering organization, with a role, in part, to recommend changes to his engineering discipline’s engineering education accreditation criteria, for subsequent review and approval by ABET. The PE Board begins to discuss these professional involvements.</p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class="row mb-4">\n    <div class="col-12">\n        <div

multiple organizational interests in their professional activities, and this can give rise to organizational conflicts of interest. Conflicts of interest are among the most prevalent ethical concerns facing engineering practitioners. Over the years, the Board of Ethical Review has considered numerous cases involving engineers who have interests in conflict with the interests of clients, employees, or other engineers. At one time, the NSPE Code of Ethics specifically prohibited engineers from becoming involved in cases or situations in which a conflict of interest was present. This was based on the view that professional engineers must at all times be above reproach and avoid any situation that could be perceived as compromising their professional judgment and integrity as independent professionals.</p>\n<p>Over time, the NSPE Code and the Board of Ethical Review have moderated to the point of recognizing that certain types of conflicts of interest are difficult, if not impossible, to avoid and that the more realistic approach for individual engineers faced with this dilemma is to fully disclose the nature and extent of the conflict to the appropriate parties involved or impacted by the conflict. This is based on the view that the parties most affected by the conflict and who have the most at stake (e.g., clients, employers, other engineering firms, etc.) are in the best position to determine whether their interests will be compromised by the conflict. While sometimes perceived conflicts of interest are resolved by the parties as a result of full disclosure, in other instances the conflicts are deeper and require the engineer to disassociate from a specific project.</p>\n<p>Previous Board of Ethical Review cases provide some background for considering this case. In <a href="https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/conflict-interest-chairman-editorial" target="_blank">BER Case No. 18-2</a>, an engineer was a board member of an engineering technical society and was actively encouraging the society to enter into an agreement with Jones Publishing, a technical journal publisher, to annually publish technical articles and content generated by the society’s members. During meetings of the engineering technical society’s board of directors, the engineer expressed strong resistance to exploring other publishing options to determine what terms and conditions other technical journal publishers might offer to the society. Under a separate private, undisclosed side agreement with Jones Publishing, the engineer was to receive a visible and prestigious position as chairman of the editorial board for another journal published by Jones Publishing if the engineering technical society agreed to enter into the agreement with the company.</p>\n<p>In this case, the BER stated the engineer had a trust relationship in his role as a board member of the engineering technical society and, therefore, must provide full disclosure regarding the side agreement with Jones Publishing to become chairman of the editorial board prior to the engineering society’s formal consideration and voting on the matter. The BER believes that conflicts of interest do not necessarily involve only financial considerations, and organizational conflicts can also be significant. In the BER’s view, the engineer also should have recused himself from his role as a board member acting on this issue for the engineering technical society or, if appropriate, resigned as a board member of the engineering technical society.</p>\n<p>A second example is <a href="https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/conflict-interest-member-legislature" target="_blank">BER Case No. 70-6</a>. Here, as a member of a state legislature, Engineer A is on a committee that initially makes appropriations to local communities for certain public works projects. He is also a partner in an engineering firm in the state. Following an appropriation to local communities in the state for projects designed to combat air pollution as recommended by the legislative committee of which Engineer A is a member, the firm of which Engineer A is a member submits its qualifications for a project to be financed by an appropriation from the legislature. At the meeting of the town council in the town in which the firm of Engineer A is located, objection is voiced to the selection of the firm in which Engineer A is a partner because of his influential position in securing the appropriation.</p>\n<p>In finding that the firm in which Engineer A is a partner may ethically perform engineering services financed by an appropriation secured in part by the position of Engineer A in the legislature, the Board noted that actual awards to the selected engineering firms were to be made by the governing bodies of the local communities. But Engineer A was not a member of the town council, and the facts do not indicate Engineer A used his political office as a means to enhance the opportunities for his firm to benefit from the legislative action.</p>\n<p>A third example is <a href="https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/conflict-interest-membership-public" target="_blank">BER Case No. 75-7</a>. In this case, John Doe, a civil engineer in private practice, is engaged principally in topographical survey work and the design of water and sewer facilities. He is an appointed member of a commission that controls and determines the issuance of water and sewer connection permits to private owners and developers. The commission’s authority is of such a nature that its decisions have a decisive impact on land development projects and the construction of facilities of all kinds by private owners. While serving on the commission, Doe performed extensive topographic survey work and designed the water and sewer systems for a new private facility that had earlier received approval for necessary water and sewer connections from the commission while he was a member of the commission. In response to public criticism for an alleged conflict of interest on his part, Doe noted that he had abstained from the discussion and vote on the permit application.</p>\n<p>Based on the fact that Doe was aware of a potential conflict of interest and he abstained from the discussion and vote, and that it was not established that Doe had influenced the decision on the permit, the Board concluded it was ethical for Doe to perform the engineering and topographic survey work for a private client while serving on the commission when the water and sewer permits were issued. However, the Board did publish a dissenting view that advocated that Doe’s involvement was simply too close and he should resign from the commission.</p>\n<p>Turning to the facts in this case, the BER believes that Engineer A should not be part of any discussion where she is advocating for the improvement of the state’s continuing professional development requirements to the PE Board and legislature. In this manner, her situation most closely parallels that of <a href="https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/conflict-interest-membership-public" target="_blank">Case No. 75-7</a>.</p>\n<p>In many states, the legislature establishes the law for continuing education requirements and the PE Board enforces that law and establishes the rules. PE Board members typically take an oath to uphold the US and State Constitutions, and to abide by the law established by the state legislature and the rules and regulations adopted by the PE Board. Members of the board of directors of an engineering professional organization typically take an oath to represent the interests of member professionals. If the member professional organization is advocating engineering issues before the legislature or the PE Board, a PE Board member who also serves on the board of the member organization would face a direct conflict. Even absent such direct advocacy, membership on both boards may still present the appearance of a conflict of interest to some members of the public. Membership in engineering professional organizations presents no such conflicts of interest, as engagement in engineering and professional issues is of benefit to PE Board members.</p>\n<p>The BER believes that Engineer A has a conflict of interest and that she should resign as a member of the board of directors of her engineering organization if she desires to serve on her state PE board. In the words of <a href="https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/conflict-interest-membership-public" target="_blank">Case 75-7</a>, her involvement “is simply too close.”</p>\n<p>The BER believes that Engineer B’s situation is completely different. Engineer B is the chair of an engineering committee of a national engineering organization, where he recommends changes to his engineering discipline’s engineering education accreditation criteria for ABET. Thus, the situation of Engineer B more closely approximates that described in <a href="https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/conflict-interest-member-legislature" target="_blank">Case No. 70-6</a>. The BER does not believe that this is a conflict of interest because individual state PE boards have no jurisdiction over ABET’s engineering education criteria. All engineering disciplines have a society that is responsible for establishing discipline-specific program criteria. State licensing board members have nothing to do with ABET’s discipline-specific criteria. Therefore, the BER does not believe that Engineer B has a conflict of interest.</p>\n</p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class="row mb-4">\n    <div class="col-12">\n        <div class="card">\n            <div class="card-header bg-light">\n                <h5 class="mb-0">Conclusions</h5>\n            </div>\n            <div class="card-body">\n<ol class="mb-0">\n    <li>Engineer A has a conflict of interest.

Conflicts of interest are among the most prevalent ethical concerns facing engineering practitioners. Over the years, the Board of Ethical Review has considered numerous cases involving engineers who have interests in conflict with the interests of clients, employees, or other engineers. At one time, the NSPE Code of Ethics specifically prohibited engineers from becoming involved in cases or situations in which a conflict of interest was present. This was based on the view that professional engineers must at all times be above reproach and avoid any situation that could be perceived as compromising their professional judgment and integrity as independent professionals.</p>\\n<p>Over time, the NSPE Code and the Board of Ethical Review have moderated to the point of recognizing that certain types of conflicts of interest are difficult, if not impossible, to avoid and that the more realistic approach for individual engineers faced with this dilemma is to fully disclose the nature and extent of the conflict to the appropriate parties involved or impacted by the conflict. This is based on the view that the parties most affected by the conflict and who have the most at stake (e.g., clients, employers, other engineering firms, etc.) are in the best position to determine whether their interests will be compromised by the conflict.

While public service does not preclude Engineer A from being a member of the state engineering organization, the BER recommends that Engineer A should resign her position as a member of the board of directors of her engineering organization if she desires to serve on her state PE board.

Engineer B does not have a conflict of interest according to the NSPE Code of Ethics.", "discussion": "Professional engineers often find themselves involved with and representing multiple organizational interests in their professional activities, and this can give rise to organizational conflicts of interest. Conflicts of interest are among the most prevalent ethical concerns facing engineering practitioners. Over the years, the Board of Ethical Review has considered numerous cases involving engineers who have interests in conflict with the interests of clients, employees, or other engineers. At one time, the NSPE Code of Ethics specifically prohibited engineers from becoming involved in cases or situations in which a conflict of interest was present. This was based on the view that professional engineers must at all times be above reproach and avoid any situation that could be perceived as compromising their professional judgment and integrity as independent professionals.\\nOver time, the NSPE Code and the Board of Ethical Review have moderated to the point of recognizing that certain types of conflicts of interest are difficult, if not impossible, to avoid and that the more realistic approach for individual engineers faced with this dilemma is to fully disclose the nature and extent of the conflict to the appropriate parties involved or impacted by the conflict. This is based on the view that the parties most affected by the conflict and who have the most at stake (e.g., clients, employers, other engineering firms, etc.) are in the best position to determine whether their interests will be compromised by the conflict. While sometimes perceived conflicts of interest are resolved by the parties as a result of full disclosure, in other instances the conflicts are deeper and require the engineer to disassociate from a specific project.\\nPrevious Board of Ethical Review cases provide some background for considering this case. In BER Case No. 18-2 , an engineer was a board member of an engineering technical society and was actively encouraging the society to enter into an agreement with Jones Publishing, a technical journal publisher, to annually publish technical articles and content generated by the society’s members. During meetings of the engineering technical society’s board of directors, the engineer expressed strong resistance to exploring other publishing options to determine what terms and conditions other technical journal publishers might offer to the society. Under a separate private, undisclosed side agreement with Jones Publishing, the engineer was to receive a visible and prestigious position as chairman of the editorial board for another journal published by Jones Publishing if the engineering technical society agreed to enter into the agreement with the company.\\nIn this case, the BER stated the engineer had a trust relationship in his role as a board member of the engineering technical society and, therefore, must provide full disclosure regarding the side agreement with Jones Publishing to become chairman of the editorial board prior to the engineering society’s formal consideration and voting on the matter. The BER believes that conflicts of interest do not necessarily involve only financial considerations, and organizational conflicts can also be significant. In the BER’s view, the engineer also should have recused himself from his role as a board member acting on this issue for the engineering technical society or, if appropriate, resigned as a board member of the engineering technical society.\\nA second example is BER Case No. 70-6 . Here, as a member of a state legislature, Engineer A is on a committee that initially makes appropriations to local communities for certain public works projects. He is also a partner in an engineering firm in the state. Following an appropriation to local communities in the state for projects designed to combat air pollution as recommended by the legislative committee of which Engineer A is a member, the firm of which Engineer A is a member submits its qualifications for a project to be financed by an appropriation from the legislature. At the meeting of the town council in the town in which the firm of Engineer A is located, objection is voiced to the selection of the firm in which Engineer A is a partner because of his influential position in securing the appropriation.\\nIn finding that the firm in which Engineer A is a partner may ethically perform engineering services financed by an appropriation secured in part by the position of Engineer A in the legislature, the Board noted that actual awards to the selected engineering firms were to be made by the governing bodies of the local communities. But Engineer A was not a member of the town council, and the facts do not indicate Engineer A used his political office as a means to enhance the opportunities for his firm to benefit from the legislative action.\\nA third example is BER Case No. 75-7 . In this case, John Doe, a civil engineer in private practice, is engaged principally in topographical survey work and the design of water and sewer facilities. He is an appointed member of a commission that controls and determines the issuance of water and sewer connection permits to private owners and developers. The commission’s authority is of such a nature that its decisions have a decisive impact on land development projects and the construction of facilities of all kinds by private owners. While serving on the commission, Doe performed extensive topographic survey work and designed the water and sewer systems for a new private facility that had earlier received approval for necessary water and sewer connections from the commission while he was a member of the commission. In response to public criticism for an alleged conflict of interest on his part, Doe noted that he had abstained from the discussion and vote on the permit application.\\nBased on the fact that Doe was aware of a potential conflict of interest and he abstained from the discussion and vote, and that it was not established that Doe had influenced the decision on the permit, the Board concluded it was ethical for Doe to perform the engineering and topographic survey work for a private client while serving on the commission when the water and sewer permits were issued. However, the Board did publish a dissenting view that advocated that Doe’s involvement was simply too close and he should resign from the commission.\\nTurning to the facts in this case, the BER believes that Engineer A should not be part of any discussion where she is advocating for the improvement of the state’s continuing professional development requirements to the PE Board and legislature. In this manner, her situation most closely parallels that of Case No. 75-7 .\\nIn many states, the legislature establishes the law for continuing education requirements and the PE Board enforces that law and establishes the rules. PE Board members typically take an oath to uphold the US and State Constitutions, and to abide by the law established by the state legislature and the rules and regulations adopted by the PE Board. Members of the board of directors of an engineering professional organization typically take an oath to represent the interests of member professionals. If the member professional organization is advocating engineering issues before the legislature or the PE Board, a PE Board member who also serves on the board of the member organization would face a direct conflict. Even absent such direct advocacy, membership on both boards may still present the appearance of a conflict of interest to some members of the public. Membership in engineering professional organizations presents no such conflicts of interest, as engagement in engineering and professional issues is of benefit to PE Board members.\\nThe BER believes that Engineer A has a conflict of interest and that she should resign as a member of the board of directors of her engineering organization if she desires to serve on her state PE board. In the words of Case 75-7 , her involvement “is simply too close.”\\nThe BER believes that Engineer B’s situation is completely different. Engineer B is the chair of an engineering committee of a national engineering organization, where he recommends changes to his engineering discipline’s engineering education accreditation criteria for ABET. Thus, the situation of Engineer B more closely approximates that described in Case No. 70-6 . The BER does not believe that this is a conflict of interest because individual state PE boards have no jurisdiction over ABET’s engineering education criteria. All engineering disciplines have a society that is responsible for establishing discipline-specific program criteria. State licensing board members have nothing to do with ABET’s discipline-specific criteria. Therefore, the BER does not believe that Engineer B has a conflict of interest.", "references": "II.3.

Engineer A responds that (1) although her state organization has been advocating for the improvement of the state’s continuing professional development requirements to the PE Board and the legislature, (2) she has not been making those presentations, but (3) that the advocacy has been discussed at meetings of the state organization’s board of directors. Engineer B responds that he is the chair of an engineering education committee of the national engineering organization, with a role, in part, to recommend changes to his engineering discipline’s engineering education accreditation criteria, for subsequent review and approval by ABET. The PE Board begins to discuss these professional involvements.", "question": "Does Engineer A have a conflict of interest with respect to PE Board service? Does Engineer B have a conflict of interest with respect to PE Board service?", "conclusion": "Engineer A has a conflict of interest. While public service does not preclude Engineer A from being a member of the state engineering organization, the BER recommends that Engineer A should resign her position as a member of the board of directors of her engineering organization if she desires to serve on her state PE board.

Conflicts of interest are among the most prevalent ethical concerns facing engineering practitioners. Over the years, the Board of Ethical Review has considered numerous cases involving engineers who have interests in conflict with the interests of clients, employees, or other engineers. At one time, the NSPE Code of Ethics specifically prohibited engineers from becoming involved in cases or situations in which a conflict of interest was present. This was based on the view that professional engineers must at all times be above reproach and avoid any situation that could be perceived as compromising their professional judgment and integrity as independent professionals.</p>\\n<p>Over time, the NSPE Code and the Board of Ethical Review have moderated to the point of recognizing that certain types of conflicts of interest are difficult, if not impossible, to avoid and that the more realistic approach for individual engineers faced with this dilemma is to fully disclose the nature and extent of the conflict to the appropriate parties involved or impacted by the conflict. This is based on the view that the parties most affected by the conflict and who have the most at stake (e.g., clients, employers, other engineering firms, etc.) are in the best position to determine whether their interests will be compromised by the conflict. While sometimes perceived conflicts of interest are resolved by the parties as a result of full disclosure, in other instances the conflicts are deeper and require the engineer to disassociate from a specific project.</p>\\n<p>Previous Board of Ethical Review cases provide some background for considering this case. In <a href=\\"https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/conflict-interest-chairman-editorial\\" target=\\"_blank\\">BER Case No. 18-2</a>, an engineer was a board member of an engineering technical society and was actively encouraging the society to enter into an agreement with Jones Publishing, a technical journal publisher, to annually publish technical articles and content generated by the society’s members. During meetings of the engineering technical society’s board of directors, the engineer expressed strong resistance to exploring other publishing options to determine what terms and conditions other technical journal publishers might offer to the society. Under a separate private, undisclosed side agreement with Jones Publishing, the engineer was to receive a visible and prestigious position as chairman of the editorial board for another journal published by Jones Publishing if the engineering technical society agreed to enter into the agreement with the company.</p>\\n<p>In this case, the BER stated the engineer had a trust relationship in his role as a board member of the engineering technical society and, therefore, must provide full disclosure regarding the side agreement with Jones Publishing to become chairman of the editorial board prior to the engineering society’s formal consideration and voting on the matter. The BER believes that conflicts of interest do not necessarily involve only financial considerations, and organizational conflicts can also be significant. In the BER’s view, the engineer also should have recused himself from his role as a board member acting on this issue for the engineering technical society or, if appropriate, resigned as a board member of the engineering technical society.</p>\\n<p>A second example is <a href=\\"https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/conflict-interest-member-legislature\\" target=\\"_blank\\">BER Case No. 70-6</a>. Here, as a member of a state legislature, Engineer A is on a committee that initially makes appropriations to local communities for certain public works projects. He is also a partner in an engineering firm in the state. Following an appropriation to local communities in the state for projects designed to combat air pollution as recommended by the legislative committee of which Engineer A is a member, the firm of which Engineer A is a member submits its qualifications for a project to be financed by an appropriation from the legislature. At the meeting of the town council in the town in which the firm of Engineer A is located, objection is voiced to the selection of the firm in which Engineer A is a partner because of his influential position in securing the appropriation.</p>\\n<p>In finding that the firm in which Engineer A is a partner may ethically perform engineering services financed by an appropriation secured in part by the position of Engineer A in the legislature, the Board noted that actual awards to the selected engineering firms were to be made by the governing bodies of the local communities. But Engineer A was not a member of the town council, and the facts do not indicate Engineer A used his political office as a means to enhance the opportunities for his firm to benefit from the legislative action.</p>\\n<p>A third example is <a href=\\"https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/conflict-interest-membership-public\\" target=\\"_blank\\">BER Case No. 75-7</a>. In this case, John Doe, a civil engineer in private practice, is engaged principally in topographical survey work and the design of water and sewer facilities. He is an appointed member of a commission that controls and determines the issuance of water and sewer connection permits to private owners and developers. The commission’s authority is of such a nature that its decisions have a decisive impact on land development projects and the construction of facilities of all kinds by private owners. While serving on the commission, Doe performed extensive topographic survey work and designed the water and sewer systems for a new private facility that had earlier received approval for necessary water and sewer connections from the commission while he was a member of the commission. In response to public criticism for an alleged conflict of interest on his part, Doe noted that he had abstained from the discussion and vote on the permit application.</p>\\n<p>Based on the fact that Doe was aware of a potential conflict of interest and he abstained from the discussion and vote, and that it was not established that Doe had influenced the decision on the permit, the Board concluded it was ethical for Doe to perform the engineering and topographic survey work for a private client while serving on the commission when the water and sewer permits were issued. However, the Board did publish a dissenting view that advocated that Doe’s involvement was simply too close and he should resign from the commission.</p>\\n<p>Turning to the facts in this case, the BER believes that Engineer A should not be part of any discussion where she is advocating for the improvement of the state’s continuing professional development requirements to the PE Board and legislature. In this manner, her situation most closely parallels that of <a href=\\"https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/conflict-interest-membership-public\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Case No. 75-7</a>.</p>\\n<p>In many states, the legislature establishes the law for continuing education requirements and the PE Board enforces that law and establishes the rules. PE Board members typically take an oath to uphold the US and State Constitutions, and to abide by the law established by the state legislature and the rules and regulations adopted by the PE Board. Members of the board of directors of an engineering professional organization typically take an oath to represent the interests of member professionals. If the member professional organization is advocating engineering issues before the legislature or the PE Board, a PE Board member who also serves on the board of the member organization would face a direct conflict. Even absent such direct advocacy, membership on both boards may still present the appearance of a conflict of interest to some members of the public. Membership in engineering professional organizations presents no such conflicts of interest, as engagement in engineering and professional issues is of benefit to PE Board members.</p>\\n<p>The BER believes that Engineer A has a conflict of interest and that she should resign as a member of the board of directors of her engineering organization if she desires to serve on her state PE board. In the words of <a href=\\"https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/conflict-interest-membership-public\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Case 75-7</a>, her involvement “is simply too close.”</p>\\n<p>The BER believes that Engineer B’s situation is completely different. Engineer B is the chair of an engineering committee of a national engineering organization, where he recommends changes to his engineering discipline’s engineering education accreditation criteria for ABET. Thus, the situation of Engineer B more closely approximates that described in <a href=\\"https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/conflict-interest-member-legislature\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Case No. 70-6</a>. The BER does not believe that this is a conflict of interest because individual state PE boards have no jurisdiction over ABET’s engineering education criteria. All engineering disciplines have a society that is responsible for establishing discipline-specific program criteria. State licensing board members have nothing to do with ABET’s discipline-specific criteria. Therefore, the BER does not believe that Engineer B has a conflict of interest.</p>\\n", "references": "<div class=\\"field__items\\">\\n<div class=\\"field__item\\"><div>\\n<h2>\\n<div class=\\"field field--name-name field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item\\">II.3.</div>\\n</h2>\\n<div>\\n<div class=\\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-description field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\\"><p>Engineers shall issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<div>Subject Reference</div>\\n<div class=\\"field__items\\">\\n<div class=\\"field__item\\"><a href=\\"https://www.nspe.org/categories/subject-reference-guide-code-ethics/public-statements-and-criticism\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Public Statements and Criticism</a></div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\"field__item\\"><div>\\n<h2>\\n<div class=\\"field field--name-name field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item\\">II.3.c.</div>\\n</h2>\\n<div>\\n<div class=\\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-description field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\\"><p>Engineers shall issue no statements, criticisms, or arguments on technical matters that are inspired or paid for by interested parties, unless they have prefaced their comments by explicitly identifying the interested parties on whose behalf they are speaking, and by revealing the existence of any interest the engineers may have in the matters.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<div>Subject Reference</div>\\n<div class=\\"field__items\\">\\n<div class=\\"field__item\\"><a href=\\"https://www.nspe.org/categories/subject-reference-guide-code-ethics/statements-technical-matters-interested-parties\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Statements on Technical Matters for Interested Parties</a></div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\"field__item\\"><div>\\n<h2>\\n<div class=\\"field field--name-name field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item\\">II.4.a.</div>\\n</h2>\\n<div>\\n<div class=\\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-description field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\\"><p>Engineers shall disclose all known or potential conflicts of interest that could influence or appear to influence their judgment or the quality of their services.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<div>Subject Reference</div>\\n<div class=\\"field__items\\">\\n<div class=\\"field__item\\"><a href=\\"https://www.nspe.org/categories/subject-reference-guide-code-ethics/conflict-interest\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Conflict of Interest</a></div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\"field__item\\"><div>\\n<h2>\\n<div class=\\"field field--name-name field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item\\">II.4.d.</div>\\n</h2>\\n<div>\\n<div class=\\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-description field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\\"><p>Engineers in public service as members, advisors, or employees of a governmental or quasi-governmental body or department shall not participate in decisions with respect to services solicited or provided by them or their organizations in private or public engineering practice.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<div>Subject Reference</div>\\n<div class=\\"field__items\\">\\n<div class=\\"field__item\\"><a href=\\"https://www.nspe.org/categories/subject-reference-guide-code-ethics/conflict-interest\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Conflict of Interest</a></div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\"field__item\\"><div>\\n<h2>\\n<div class=\\"field field--name-name field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item\\">II.4.e.</div>\\n</h2>\\n<div>\\n<div class=\\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-description field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\\"><p>Engineers shall not solicit or accept a contract from a governmental body on which a principal or officer of their organization serves as a member.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<div>Subject Reference</div>\\n<div class=\\"field__items\\">\\n<div class=\\"field__item\\"><a href=\\"https://www.nspe.org/categories/subject-reference-guide-code-ethics/conflict-interest\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Conflict of Interest</a></div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\"field__item\\"><div>\\n<h2>\\n<div class=\\"field field--name-name field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item\\">III.2.a.</div>\\n</h2>\\n<div>\\n<div class=\\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-description field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\\"><p>Engineers are encouraged to participate in civic affairs;

Martin and Schinzinger, in their text, <em>Ethics in Engineering</em><a href=\\"https://www.nspe.org#section1\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><span style=\\"vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller;\\">1</span></a>, state: We can refine our definition of conflict of interest when two conditions are met:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n\\t\\tThe professional is in a relationship or role that requires exercising good judgment on behalf of the interests of an employer or client.</li>\\n<li>\\n\\t\\tThe professional has some additional or side interest that could threaten good judgment in serving the interests of the employer or client—either the good judgment of that professional or the judgment of a typical professional in that situation.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>In the case of Engineer A, service on both boards requires exercising good judgment; the first condition for a conflict of interest is met. When serving on the PE Board, the discussion of this case established that the ultimate client is the public. Similarly, a fundamental canon of the NSPE Code of Ethics states that in the performance of their professional duties, engineers shall hold paramount the public health, safety, and welfare. Engineer A’s service on both boards is in the interest of the public and judgment will be exercised on the public’s behalf.</p>\\n<p>Further, NSPE’s Code of Ethics indicates that an engineer’s professional obligations include striving to serve the public interest; listed activities include service in civic affairs and continued professional development throughout one’s career. These obligations do not fall solely to board members of professional engineering organizations—they apply to all engineers. Advocacy for development and maintenance of professional competence is not an additional or side interest that threatens Engineer A’s good judgment; it is an integral part of Engineer A’s obligation as an engineer. The second condition in Martin and Schinzinger’s definition is not met.</p>\\n<p>In case 75-7, the BER stated “Some very thin and difficult lines must be drawn in applying that principle lest we inadvertently hold that an engineer involved in work generally subject to public agency action may never serve on public bodies which even remotely relate to his general field of practice.”</p>\\n<p><strong>Dissenting Opinion Conclusion (as to Engineer A only):</strong><br/>\\n\\tEngineering A must disclose status as a board member of a membership engineering organization; however, participation on both boards does not present a conflict of interest during regular PE Board activities .

In this case, John Doe, a civil engineer in private practice, is engaged principally in topographical survey work and the design of water and sewer facilities.

The commission’s authority is of such a nature that its decisions have a decisive impact on land development projects and the construction of facilities of all kinds by private owners.

Conflicts of interest are among the most prevalent ethical concerns facing engineering practitioners. Over the years, the Board of Ethical Review has considered numerous cases involving engineers who have interests in conflict with the interests of clients, employees, or other engineers. At one time, the NSPE Code of Ethics specifically prohibited engineers from becoming involved in cases or situations in which a conflict of interest was present.

This is based on the view that the parties most affected by the conflict and who have the most at stake (e.g., clients, employers, other engineering firms, etc.) are in the best position to determine whether their interests will be compromised by the conflict. While sometimes perceived conflicts of interest are resolved by the parties as a result of full disclosure, in other instances the conflicts are deeper and require the engineer to disassociate from a specific project.</p>\\n<p>Previous Board of Ethical Review cases provide some background for considering this case. In <a href=\\"https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/conflict-interest-chairman-editorial\\" target=\\"_blank\\">BER Case No. 18-2</a>, an engineer was a board member of an engineering technical society and was actively encouraging the society to enter into an agreement with Jones Publishing, a technical journal publisher, to annually publish technical articles and content generated by the society’s members. During meetings of the engineering technical society’s board of directors, the engineer expressed strong resistance to exploring other publishing options to determine what terms and conditions other technical journal publishers might offer to the society. Under a separate private, undisclosed side agreement with Jones Publishing, the engineer was to receive a visible and prestigious position as chairman of the editorial board for another journal published by Jones Publishing if the engineering technical society agreed to enter into the agreement with the company.</p>\\n<p>In this case, the BER stated the engineer had a trust relationship in his role as a board member of the engineering technical society and, therefore, must provide full disclosure regarding the side agreement with Jones Publishing to become chairman of the editorial board prior to the engineering society’s formal consideration and voting on the matter. The BER believes that conflicts of interest do not necessarily involve only financial considerations, and organizational conflicts can also be significant. In the BER’s view, the engineer also should have recused himself from his role as a board member acting on this issue for the engineering technical society or, if appropriate, resigned as a board member of the engineering technical society.</p>\\n<p>A second example is <a href=\\"https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/conflict-interest-member-legislature\\" target=\\"_blank\\">BER Case No. 70-6</a>. Here, as a member of a state legislature, Engineer A is on a committee that initially makes appropriations to local communities for certain public works projects. He is also a partner in an engineering firm in the state. Following an appropriation to local communities in the state for projects designed to combat air pollution as recommended by the legislative committee of which Engineer A is a member, the firm of which Engineer A is a member submits its qualifications for a project to be financed by an appropriation from the legislature. At the meeting of the town council in the town in which the firm of Engineer A is located, objection is voiced to the selection of the firm in which Engineer A is a partner because of his influential position in securing the appropriation.</p>\\n<p>In finding that the firm in which Engineer A is a partner may ethically perform engineering services financed by an appropriation secured in part by the position of Engineer A in the legislature, the Board noted that actual awards to the selected engineering firms were to be made by the governing bodies of the local communities. But Engineer A was not a member of the town council, and the facts do not indicate Engineer A used his political office as a means to enhance the opportunities for his firm to benefit from the legislative action.</p>\\n<p>A third example is <a href=\\"https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/conflict-interest-membership-public\\" target=\\"_blank\\">BER Case No. 75-7</a>. In this case, John Doe, a civil engineer in private practice, is engaged principally in topographical survey work and the design of water and sewer facilities. He is an appointed member of a commission that controls and determines the issuance of water and sewer connection permits to private owners and developers. The commission’s authority is of such a nature that its decisions have a decisive impact on land development projects and the construction of facilities of all kinds by private owners. While serving on the commission, Doe performed extensive topographic survey work and designed the water and sewer systems for a new private facility that had earlier received approval for necessary water and sewer connections from the commission while he was a member of the commission. In response to public criticism for an alleged conflict of interest on his part, Doe noted that he had abstained from the discussion and vote on the permit application.</p>\\n<p>Based on the fact that Doe was aware of a potential conflict of interest and he abstained from the discussion and vote, and that it was not established that Doe had influenced the decision on the permit, the Board concluded it was ethical for Doe to perform the engineering and topographic survey work for a private client while serving on the commission when the water and sewer permits were issued. However, the Board did publish a dissenting view that advocated that Doe’s involvement was simply too close and he should resign from the commission.</p>\\n<p>Turning to the facts in this case, the BER believes that Engineer A should not be part of any discussion where she is advocating for the improvement of the state’s continuing professional development requirements to the PE Board and legislature. In this manner, her situation most closely parallels that of <a href=\\"https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/conflict-interest-membership-public\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Case No. 75-7</a>.</p>\\n<p>In many states, the legislature establishes the law for continuing education requirements and the PE Board enforces that law and establishes the rules. PE Board members typically take an oath to uphold the US and State Constitutions, and to abide by the law established by the state legislature and the rules and regulations adopted by the PE Board. Members of the board of directors of an engineering professional organization typically take an oath to represent the interests of member professionals. If the member professional organization is advocating engineering issues before the legislature or the PE Board, a PE Board member who also serves on the board of the member organization would face a direct conflict. Even absent such direct advocacy, membership on both boards may still present the appearance of a conflict of interest to some members of the public. Membership in engineering professional organizations presents no such conflicts of interest, as engagement in engineering and professional issues is of benefit to PE Board members.</p>\\n<p>The BER believes that Engineer A has a conflict of interest and that she should resign as a member of the board of directors of her engineering organization if she desires to serve on her state PE board. In the words of <a href=\\"https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/conflict-interest-membership-public\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Case 75-7</a>, her involvement “is simply too close.”</p>\\n<p>The BER believes that Engineer B’s situation is completely different. Engineer B is the chair of an engineering committee of a national engineering organization, where he recommends changes to his engineering discipline’s engineering education accreditation criteria for ABET.

The BER does not believe that this is a conflict of interest because individual state PE boards have no jurisdiction over ABET’s engineering education criteria. All engineering disciplines have a society that is responsible for establishing discipline-specific program criteria.

Martin and Schinzinger, in their text, Ethics in Engineering 1 , state: We can refine our definition of conflict of interest when two conditions are met:\\nThe professional is in a relationship or role that requires exercising good judgment on behalf of the interests of an employer or client. The professional has some additional or side interest that could threaten good judgment in serving the interests of the employer or client—either the good judgment of that professional or the judgment of a typical professional in that situation.\\n1. The professional is in a relationship or role that requires exercising good judgment on behalf of the interests of an employer or client.\\n2. The professional has some additional or side interest that could threaten good judgment in serving the interests of the employer or client—either the good judgment of that professional or the judgment of a typical professional in that situation.\\nIn the case of Engineer A, service on both boards requires exercising good judgment; the first condition for a conflict of interest is met. When serving on the PE Board, the discussion of this case established that the ultimate client is the public. Similarly, a fundamental canon of the NSPE Code of Ethics states that in the performance of their professional duties, engineers shall hold paramount the public health, safety, and welfare. Engineer A’s service on both boards is in the interest of the public and judgment will be exercised on the public’s behalf.\\nFurther, NSPE’s Code of Ethics indicates that an engineer’s professional obligations include striving to serve the public interest; listed activities include service in civic affairs and continued professional development throughout one’s career. These obligations do not fall solely to board members of professional engineering organizations—they apply to all engineers. Advocacy for development and maintenance of professional competence is not an additional or side interest that threatens Engineer A’s good judgment; it is an integral part of Engineer A’s obligation as an engineer. The second condition in Martin and Schinzinger’s definition is not met.\\nIn case 75-7, the BER stated “Some very thin and difficult lines must be drawn in applying that principle lest we inadvertently hold that an engineer involved in work generally subject to public agency action may never serve on public bodies which even remotely relate to his general field of practice.”\\nDissenting Opinion Conclusion (as to Engineer A only): Engineering A must disclose status as a board member of a membership engineering organization; however, participation on both boards does not present a conflict of interest during regular PE Board activities . In the event the PE Board considers a rule that the engineering organization is advocating, recusal from the vote is the appropriate action for Engineer A.\\n1 Martin, Mike W., Schinzinger, Roland, Ethics in Engineering , 4th Edition (McGraw-Hill, 2005), p. 159.", "content_type": "text"}}, "association_processing_phase": "saving_results", "association_processing_status": "completed", "association_processing_progress": 100}	completed	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-18 12:10:32.081784	2025-07-18 12:32:50.561268
4	Acknowledging Errors in Design	https://www.nspe.org/career-growth/ethics/board-ethical-review-cases/acknowledging-errors-design	case_study	1	\N	url	\n<div class="row mb-4">\n    <div class="col-12">\n        <div class="card">\n            <div class="card-header bg-light">\n                <h5 class="mb-0">Facts</h5>\n            </div>\n            <div class="card-body">\n                <p class="mb-0">Engineer T, a senior structural engineer who designs commercial buildings in the employ of XYZ Consulting Engineers, was in responsible charge of the design of major structural modifications to an existing building. In establishing the project scope for the structural modifications, Engineer T selected a straightforward approach that required making structural connections immediately beneath floor level on an upper floor, in a tightly constrained space. Engineer T proceeded with the project per these parameters and did not explore alternative design approaches. Rather, Engineer T completed the design within the identified constraints and issued construction documents for the modifications.The new structural connections were located in such a way that access was limited, and the drawings clearly noted the constrained access. This design detail required the construction workers to make the connections in a contorted fashion. During construction, an accident occurred with a serious and permanent injury to a construction worker. Following the accident, Engineer T revisited the site and realized that had alternative design concepts been explored early on, the new structural modifications could have been proposed in a fundamentally different, more complex, but functionally equivalent way. The alternative approach would have been more costly and taken more time, but it would have allowed the construction workers to make all connections while standing on the floor such that injury would have been far less likely. Engineer T felt some personal responsibility for the accident.Engineer T met with XYZ’s Chief Structural Engineer, Engineer B, explained the situation, and expressed a belief that a design error – i.e., not exploring alternative, safer design concepts – had been made and the NSPE Code of Ethics required that the error be acknowledged. Engineer B responded that Engineer T and XYZ Consulting Engineers had responded professionally to the design project, they had recommended a straightforward structural modification approach, and they were not expected or asked to consider alternative concepts. Further, Engineer T had specifically identified the constrained area of the new connections in the design documents, but because T was not trained in construction safety either by education (since civil engineering education typically does not include construction safety) or by specific experience (working for a construction contractor), Engineer T could not have reasonably known or assessed the level of worker safety risk posed by the connection location. The contractor had not raised questions regarding the construction safety risk or safer construction alternatives. Having thus thoughtfully considered the matter, both Engineer T and Engineer B decided that the situation did not merit acknowledgement of “an error.”Months later, after a construction claim had been submitted and a lawsuit had been filed, Engineer T met with attorneys representing XYZ and XYZ’s insurance company to prepare for a deposition of Engineer T. During preparation, Engineer T reviewed and discussed the project history, including the conversation with Engineer B relative to T’s feeling there was, potentially, a professional obligation to acknowledge an error – i.e., not exploring alternative, safer design concepts. Both of XYZ Consulting Engineers’ attorneys agreed that a clear obligation existed not to distort or alter any facts, and that Engineer T should respond to questions with complete transparency during the deposition. They pointed out, however, that whether an error was made was not up to Engineer T and was not clear in this set of circumstances, including for the reasons that Engineer B had indicated to Engineer T earlier. They also pointed out that one of the purposes of the legal process was to determine what errors might have been made and by whom, and what impact such errors might have had on the accident. The attorneys indicated that the legal process would determine whether, based on the facts, an error had been made, and that Engineer T should clearly report the facts, but should not voluntarily characterize the design work as an error.In the deposition, Engineer T responded factually to all questions regarding the design and the design process. Engineer T was not asked if an error had been made and did not offer an acknowledgement of a possible error.</p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class="row mb-4">\n    <div class="col-12">\n        <div class="card">\n            <div class="card-header bg-light">\n                <h5 class="mb-0">Questions</h5>\n            </div>\n            <div class="card-body">\n<ol class="mb-0">\n    <li>Was it ethical for Engineer T and Engineer B to conclude an error had not been made in design?</li>\n    <li>Was it ethical for Engineer T not to acknowledge an error after the accident occurred?</li>\n    <li>Was it ethical for Engineer T not to acknowledge an error during the deposition?</li>\n</ol>\n\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class="row mb-4">\n    <div class="col-12">\n        <div class="card">\n            <div class="card-header bg-light">\n                <h5 class="mb-0">NSPE Code of Ethics References</h5>\n            </div>\n            <div class="card-body">\n                <p class="mb-0"><div class="field__items">\n<div class="field__item"><div>\n<h2>\n<div class="field field--name-name field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item">I.1.</div>\n</h2>\n<div>\n<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-description field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>Subject Reference</div>\n<div class="field__items">\n<div class="field__item"><a href="https://www.nspe.org/categories/subject-reference-guide-code-ethics/duty-the-public" target="_blank">Duty to the Public</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="field__item"><div>\n<h2>\n<div class="field field--name-name field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item">I.2.</div>\n</h2>\n<div>\n<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-description field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Perform services only in areas of their competence.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>Subject Reference</div>\n<div class="field__items">\n<div class="field__item"><a href="https://www.nspe.org/categories/subject-reference-guide-code-ethics/competence" target="_blank">Competence</a></div>\n<div class="field__item"><a href="https://www.nspe.org/categories/subject-reference-guide-code-ethics/qualifications-work" target="_blank">Qualifications for Work</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="field__item"><div>\n<h2>\n<div class="field field--name-name field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item">I.3.</div>\n</h2>\n<div>\n<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-description field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>Subject Reference</div>\n<div class="field__items">\n<div class="field__item"><a href="https://www.nspe.org/categories/subject-reference-guide-code-ethics/public-statements-and-criticism" target="_blank">Public Statements and Criticism</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="field__item"><div>\n<h2>\n<div class="field field--name-name field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item">I.4.</div>\n</h2>\n<div>\n<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-description field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Act for each employer or client as faithful agents or trustees.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>Subject Reference</div>\n<div class="field__items">\n<div class="field__item"><a href="https://www.nspe.org/categories/subject-reference-guide-code-ethics/employer" target="_blank">Employer</a></div>\n<div class="field__item"><a href="https://www.nspe.org/categories/subject-reference-guide-code-ethics/faithful-agents-and-trustees" target="_blank">Faithful Agents and Trustees</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="field__item"><div>\n<h2>\n<div class="field field--name-name field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item">II.3.a.</div>\n</h2>\n<div>\n<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-description field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Engineers shall be objective and truthful in professional reports, statements, or testimony.

On the legal/contractual side, many professional engineers familiar with construction contracts believe contract language sufficiently settles the matter. They point to standard construction contract provisions such as, “Contractor shall be solely responsible for the means, methods, techniques, sequences, and procedures of construction” (Engineers Joint Contract Documents Committee [EJCDC], C-700, Standard General Conditions of the Construction Contract, Article 7, Paragraph 7.01A). The construction contracts also include provisions identifying the Contractor’s sole responsibility for initiating, maintaining, and supervising all safety programs and precautions (Article 7, Paragraph 7.13A), for obtaining additional services as needed to carry out Contractor’s safety responsibilities (Article 7, Paragraph 7.01B), and for taking necessary precautions for safety and providing necessary protection to prevent damage, injury, or loss to all persons on the site who may be affected by the work (Article 7, Paragraph 7.13C). Through these legal/contractual mechanisms, risk and responsibility for worker safety during construction are formally transferred to the contractor, the contractor being the party best positioned to provide for project safety.  By this view, and with reference to the present case, the contractor is solely responsible for project safety, so Engineer T did not make any design error so long as the design met the professional standard of care (which the facts suggest it did).</p><p>But engineers must also consider the ethical perspective, and that is the primary area of concern for the Board of Ethical Review. Ethically, the facts of this case reveal a tension between the engineer doing what is professionally required, versus ”going above and beyond” in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare. The Board has considered this ethical tension in various ways over the years.</p><p><a href="https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/duty-report-unrelated-information" target="_blank">BER Case 97-13</a> introduces Engineer A, a civil engineer, who serves as a subconsultant to perform bridge inspection services on a major bridge overhaul project. Engineer A’s scope of work is solely to identify any pavement damage on the bridge and report the damage to its client, VWX Architects. While conducting the bridge inspection, and although not part of the scope of services for which he was retained, Engineer A notices an apparent pre-existing defective condition in a retaining wall which failed to restrain a vehicle, leading to a fatal accident involving Police Officer B. Engineer A surmises that the defective condition may have been a contributing factor in the wall failure and notes this in the engineering notes. Engineer A verbally reports this information to the client, which then verbally reports the information to the public agency. In finding it was ethical for Engineer A to retain the information in the engineering notes, but not include it in the final written report, the Board noted that Engineer A did the appropriate thing in coming forward to the client with the information and also by documenting the information for possible future reference as appropriate. But under the circumstances “it would have been improper for Engineer A to include reference to the information in his final report, particularly since it would have been based upon mere speculation and not careful testing or evaluation by a competent individual or firm.” In fact, the Board opined that had Engineer A formally “reported” the matter publicly, it would have been “an overreaction and could easily have risked jeopardizing the professional reputations of [Engineer A’s] client and the public agency.” The key finding from <span class="case-reference">Case 97-13</span> is that the public welfare was best served by Engineer A exercising restraint in reporting. This parallels the current case, where Engineer A identified a safety risk in the design details, but per customary professional practice relied on the contractor (who had specific construction safety expertise) to address the issue. </p><p>A second example is <a href="https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/public-health-safety-and-welfare-4" target="_blank">BER Case 21-2</a>, where a second Engineer A serves as a consulting engineer representing Client B, a developer who is proposing to develop a healthcare facility that requires a significant upgrade to the property’s access road that crosses a tidal saltmarsh. Engineer A’s scope includes design and local permitting of the roadway, including an upgrade of the tidal crossing from a small culvert to a small bridge, increasing its hydraulic capacity. The local development regulations and national design codes and standards have not yet been updated to reflect changing conditions and weather patterns, including effects of sea level rise and changes in precipitation intensities and recurrence intervals effected by on-going climate change. It is Engineer A’s judgment, based on hydraulic evaluation procedures presented at a recent transportation agency conference, that the proposed project may result in some upstream homes becoming uninhabitable a decade or more earlier than would otherwise be the case. Engineer A proposes a complex and costly hydrologic and hydraulic analysis by a specialized subconsultant to predict the extent to which sea level rise and the increased hydraulic capacity of the tidal crossing will result in flood damage to a neighborhood of twenty upstream homes during future high tides and storm surges, anticipating this to be a difficult question to answer in the project’s public hearings. Client B directs Engineer A to proceed without the costly analysis unless and until such an analysis is requested by the applicable regulatory authorities. In this case, the BER found that “if Engineer A is reasonably certain that the project will result in adverse impacts to public health, safety, and welfare, and if the Client B denies the requisite evaluation, Engineer A should include the concern regarding potential adverse public health, safety, and welfare impacts in an engineering report for consideration by regulatory agencies and the public.” Thus, the key finding from <span class="case-reference">Case 21-2</span> is that the public welfare was best served by Engineer A reporting the public health, safety, and welfare concerns, even if the client did not wish for this to be done. This differs from the current case, not because public health, safety, and welfare is somehow less important now than in <span class="case-reference">Case 21-2</span>, but because a project delivery process exists in this case by which it was accepted professional practice for Engineer A to complete the structural design, and rely on the contractor to handle safety aspects of construction. The Engineer A from <span class="case-reference">Case 21-2</span> did not have this option.</p><p>Finally, there is <a href="https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/professional-competence-current" target="_blank">BER Case 02-5</a> where a third Engineer A, a structural engineer with experience in the design of structures in the region in which the current project is located, designed a structural system that Engineer A believed was sound and met applicable codes. However, new and improved design methods had recently been suggested in an article published in a technical journal, addressing new information regarding severe weather design in that region. Engineer A had not read that technical journal article. Within a year following construction, the building was damaged by severe weather conditions. It was determined that had the methods suggested in the technical articles been utilized in design, the damage would not have occurred. The BER concluded that it was not unethical for Engineer A to fail to follow methods suggested in a recent technical journal article that Engineer A had not reviewed. The BER indicated that they believed that the definition of what is “current practice” must be discerning and reasonable. The key finding from <span class="case-reference">Case 02-5</span> was that engineers cannot be expected (obligated) to incorporate each and every new, innovative technique until such techniques are incorporated into generally accepted practice and become standards that should be followed. Engineer T (in the current case) and Engineer A (<span class="case-reference">Case 02-5</span>) both followed accepted standard design practice. But these same engineers also had the opportunity (not obligation) to take the public welfare more firmly into account, to go above and beyond what was legally and ethically required. While they cannot be ethically faulted for not “going the extra mile” for the sake of the public health, safety, and welfare, the project outcomes likely would have been better if these engineers had done so. In hindsight, knowing the outcomes, the BER believes all parties would have wanted to at least consider the opportunity.</p><p>Collectively, the prior BER Cases reveal several principles to guide the engineer relative to the ethics of the situation. First, the engineer must hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public. Second, engineers must be competent in their areas of service. Third, engineers must be honest, and issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner. Fourth, the engineer must acknowledge their errors and not distort or alter the facts. These ethical obligations are required, and non-negotiable. So it is within this context that the engineer must determine how best to satisfy their obligations. The facts of the present case do not raise concerns about Engineer T’s competence in performing structural engineering design work. Further, Engineer T’s structural modification approach appears to have been straightforward, professionally designed, and properly presented in the construction documents. Not only this, but the design specifically mentions that the new structural connections were located in such a way that access was limited. These points demonstrate proper awareness and consideration of public safety, health, and welfare. When the design was completed, the facts imply Engineer T relied on the contractor to provide for worker safety during construction, and formally transferred this risk and responsibility via standard contractual language. Further, the facts indicate the contractor accepted the construction risk and responsibility without any question. On this basis, the facts do not suggest Engineer T made a design error. As with Engineer A in <span class="case-reference">Case 97-13</span>, the fact that Engineer T (this present case) noticed after the accident that an alternative design approach could have prevented the worker injury does not mean that Engineer T was required to report this as an error.</p><p>But the question remains – similar to <span class="case-reference">Case 21-2</span> and <span class="case-reference">Case 02-5</span> – whether Engineer T did all that could have been done for worker safety? After all, the solution approach Engineer T followed for this project did include an unusual and challenging construction aspect. Was it enough simply to call attention to this and shift safety responsibility to the contractor? <span class="case-reference">Case 21-2</span> suggests it would have been ethically appropriate (an opportunity, not an obligation) for Engineer T to identify not just the straightforward design alternative, but also the more involved structural modification concept, to identify and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of both options, and to place these matters before the client and other members of the design team, possibly including the contractor, early in the process. Another option would have been for Engineer T to request a constructability review, or an independent construction safety review, or to inquire whether the contractor’s construction safety plan had flagged the heightened safety risk. If so, perhaps the issue would have been raised and alternatives might have been addressed. But Engineer T did not actively seek this input, and perhaps that is why Engineer T “felt some personal responsibility for the accident.”</p><p>But was this an “error?” Did Engineer T and/or Engineer B deviate from ethical engineering practice under the facts? The BER affirms the “ethical high road” of considering more than one design approach, and certainly the BER would agree with seeking critical input from construction safety professionals. But as in <span class="case-reference">Case 02-5</span>, the BER does not view Engineer T’s design as unethical. While the construction accident and worker injury are tragic outcomes, because Engineer T’s design approach represented professional practice consistent with the standard of care, the BER sees this more as a missed opportunity than an ethical lapse and concludes that no “error” was made in design.</p><p>Was it ethical for Engineer T not to acknowledge an error after the accident occurred? The facts of this case and especially the discussion between Engineer T and Engineer B, as well as the legal/contractual perspective and ethical considerations outlined above, provide a rationale as to why Engineer T’s design was not an “error.” Because there was no error, Engineer T was not ethically obligated to acknowledge an error after the accident occurred. However, the BER believes this project was a missed opportunity for Engineer T to more fully and carefully hold paramount the public safety, health, and welfare.</p><p>The BER believes Engineer T should state that while no error was made, based on hindsight, other ways to approach the project existed which may have prevented the accident and worker injury. The view is consistent with ethics provisions that require engineers to be objective and truthful in professional reports, statements, or testimony; that engineers include all relevant and pertinent information, that they not distort or alter the facts, and avoid the use of statements containing a material misrepresentation of fact or omitting a material fact; and that they accept personal responsibility for their professional activities. Such conversation will not only allow Engineer T’s firm and others to benefit from lessons learned through this very difficult experience but will also promote continued professional development relative to projects of this type.  </p><p>Was it ethical for Engineer T not to acknowledge an error during the deposition? Again, using the same analysis presented above, the BER concludes that Engineer T’s design was not an “error.” Because there was no error, Engineer T was not ethically obligated to acknowledge an error during the deposition. Engineer T should respond clearly and honestly when questioned about the project, including T’s views on alternative design approaches vis-à-vis the public safety, health, and welfare, but should not characterize the work as a design error.</p></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class="row mb-4">\n    <div class="col-12">\n        <div class="card">\n            <div class="card-header bg-light">\n                <h5 class="mb-0">Conclusions</h5>\n            </div>\n            <div class="card-body">\n<ol class="mb-0">\n    <li>It was ethical for Engineer T and Engineer B to conclude no error had been made in design, based on review and analysis of the facts from both from a legal/contractual perspective and from an ethical perspective.

In establishing the project scope for the structural modifications, Engineer T selected a straightforward approach that required making structural connections immediately beneath floor level on an upper floor, in a tightly constrained space. Engineer T proceeded with the project per these parameters and did not explore alternative design approaches. Rather, Engineer T completed the design within the identified constraints and issued construction documents for the modifications.The new structural connections were located in such a way that access was limited, and the drawings clearly noted the constrained access. This design detail required the construction workers to make the connections in a contorted fashion. During construction, an accident occurred with a serious and permanent injury to a construction worker. Following the accident, Engineer T revisited the site and realized that had alternative design concepts been explored early on, the new structural modifications could have been proposed in a fundamentally different, more complex, but functionally equivalent way. The alternative approach would have been more costly and taken more time, but it would have allowed the construction workers to make all connections while standing on the floor such that injury would have been far less likely. Engineer T felt some personal responsibility for the accident.Engineer T met with XYZ’s Chief Structural Engineer, Engineer B, explained the situation, and expressed a belief that a design error – i.e., not exploring alternative, safer design concepts – had been made and the NSPE Code of Ethics required that the error be acknowledged. Engineer B responded that Engineer T and XYZ Consulting Engineers had responded professionally to the design project, they had recommended a straightforward structural modification approach, and they were not expected or asked to consider alternative concepts. Further, Engineer T had specifically identified the constrained area of the new connections in the design documents, but because T was not trained in construction safety either by education (since civil engineering education typically does not include construction safety) or by specific experience (working for a construction contractor), Engineer T could not have reasonably known or assessed the level of worker safety risk posed by the connection location. The contractor had not raised questions regarding the construction safety risk or safer construction alternatives. Having thus thoughtfully considered the matter, both Engineer T and Engineer B decided that the situation did not merit acknowledgement of “an error.”Months later, after a construction claim had been submitted and a lawsuit had been filed, Engineer T met with attorneys representing XYZ and XYZ’s insurance company to prepare for a deposition of Engineer T. During preparation, Engineer T reviewed and discussed the project history, including the conversation with Engineer B relative to T’s feeling there was, potentially, a professional obligation to acknowledge an error – i.e., not exploring alternative, safer design concepts. Both of XYZ Consulting Engineers’ attorneys agreed that a clear obligation existed not to distort or alter any facts, and that Engineer T should respond to questions with complete transparency during the deposition. They pointed out, however, that whether an error was made was not up to Engineer T and was not clear in this set of circumstances, including for the reasons that Engineer B had indicated to Engineer T earlier. They also pointed out that one of the purposes of the legal process was to determine what errors might have been made and by whom, and what impact such errors might have had on the accident. The attorneys indicated that the legal process would determine whether, based on the facts, an error had been made, and that Engineer T should clearly report the facts, but should not voluntarily characterize the design work as an error.In the deposition, Engineer T responded factually to all questions regarding the design and the design process. Engineer T was not asked if an error had been made and did not offer an acknowledgement of a possible error.", "question": "Was it ethical for Engineer T and Engineer B to conclude an error had not been made in design?Was it ethical for Engineer T not to acknowledge an error after the accident occurred?Was it ethical for Engineer T not to acknowledge an error during the deposition?", "conclusion": "It was ethical for Engineer T and Engineer B to conclude no error had been made in design, based on review and analysis of the facts from both from a legal/contractual perspective and from an ethical perspective. Engineer T’s design approach represented professional practice consistent with the standard of care.It was ethical for Engineer T not to acknowledge an error after the accident occurred because there was no error.

Engineer T should respond clearly and honestly when questioned about the project, including views on alternative design approaches vis-à-vis the public safety, health, and welfare, but should not characterize the work as a design error.", "discussion": "<p>This case addresses two ethical issues in engineering practice: to what extent are design engineers obligated to account for construction safety risks in their designs if they are not trained or have experience in construction safety methods, and are engineers obligated by the NSPE Code of Ethics to “acknowledge errors” when it is not clear an error has been made.</p><p>The first issue, having to do with considering construction safety risks in the design, can be approached from both a legal/contractual (i.e., risk management) perspective and from an ethical perspective. On the legal/contractual side, many professional engineers familiar with construction contracts believe contract language sufficiently settles the matter. They point to standard construction contract provisions such as, “Contractor shall be solely responsible for the means, methods, techniques, sequences, and procedures of construction” (Engineers Joint Contract Documents Committee [EJCDC], C-700, Standard General Conditions of the Construction Contract, Article 7, Paragraph 7.01A). The construction contracts also include provisions identifying the Contractor’s sole responsibility for initiating, maintaining, and supervising all safety programs and precautions (Article 7, Paragraph 7.13A), for obtaining additional services as needed to carry out Contractor’s safety responsibilities (Article 7, Paragraph 7.01B), and for taking necessary precautions for safety and providing necessary protection to prevent damage, injury, or loss to all persons on the site who may be affected by the work (Article 7, Paragraph 7.13C). Through these legal/contractual mechanisms, risk and responsibility for worker safety during construction are formally transferred to the contractor, the contractor being the party best positioned to provide for project safety.  By this view, and with reference to the present case, the contractor is solely responsible for project safety, so Engineer T did not make any design error so long as the design met the professional standard of care (which the facts suggest it did).</p><p>But engineers must also consider the ethical perspective, and that is the primary area of concern for the Board of Ethical Review. Ethically, the facts of this case reveal a tension between the engineer doing what is professionally required, versus ”going above and beyond” in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare. The Board has considered this ethical tension in various ways over the years.</p><p><a href=\\"https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/duty-report-unrelated-information\\" target=\\"_blank\\">BER Case 97-13</a> introduces Engineer A, a civil engineer, who serves as a subconsultant to perform bridge inspection services on a major bridge overhaul project. Engineer A’s scope of work is solely to identify any pavement damage on the bridge and report the damage to its client, VWX Architects. While conducting the bridge inspection, and although not part of the scope of services for which he was retained, Engineer A notices an apparent pre-existing defective condition in a retaining wall which failed to restrain a vehicle, leading to a fatal accident involving Police Officer B. Engineer A surmises that the defective condition may have been a contributing factor in the wall failure and notes this in the engineering notes. Engineer A verbally reports this information to the client, which then verbally reports the information to the public agency. In finding it was ethical for Engineer A to retain the information in the engineering notes, but not include it in the final written report, the Board noted that Engineer A did the appropriate thing in coming forward to the client with the information and also by documenting the information for possible future reference as appropriate. But under the circumstances “it would have been improper for Engineer A to include reference to the information in his final report, particularly since it would have been based upon mere speculation and not careful testing or evaluation by a competent individual or firm.” In fact, the Board opined that had Engineer A formally “reported” the matter publicly, it would have been “an overreaction and could easily have risked jeopardizing the professional reputations of [Engineer A’s] client and the public agency.” The key finding from <span class=\\"case-reference\\">Case 97-13</span> is that the public welfare was best served by Engineer A exercising restraint in reporting. This parallels the current case, where Engineer A identified a safety risk in the design details, but per customary professional practice relied on the contractor (who had specific construction safety expertise) to address the issue. </p><p>A second example is <a href=\\"https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/public-health-safety-and-welfare-4\\" target=\\"_blank\\">BER Case 21-2</a>, where a second Engineer A serves as a consulting engineer representing Client B, a developer who is proposing to develop a healthcare facility that requires a significant upgrade to the property’s access road that crosses a tidal saltmarsh. Engineer A’s scope includes design and local permitting of the roadway, including an upgrade of the tidal crossing from a small culvert to a small bridge, increasing its hydraulic capacity. The local development regulations and national design codes and standards have not yet been updated to reflect changing conditions and weather patterns, including effects of sea level rise and changes in precipitation intensities and recurrence intervals effected by on-going climate change. It is Engineer A’s judgment, based on hydraulic evaluation procedures presented at a recent transportation agency conference, that the proposed project may result in some upstream homes becoming uninhabitable a decade or more earlier than would otherwise be the case. Engineer A proposes a complex and costly hydrologic and hydraulic analysis by a specialized subconsultant to predict the extent to which sea level rise and the increased hydraulic capacity of the tidal crossing will result in flood damage to a neighborhood of twenty upstream homes during future high tides and storm surges, anticipating this to be a difficult question to answer in the project’s public hearings. Client B directs Engineer A to proceed without the costly analysis unless and until such an analysis is requested by the applicable regulatory authorities. In this case, the BER found that “if Engineer A is reasonably certain that the project will result in adverse impacts to public health, safety, and welfare, and if the Client B denies the requisite evaluation, Engineer A should include the concern regarding potential adverse public health, safety, and welfare impacts in an engineering report for consideration by regulatory agencies and the public.” Thus, the key finding from <span class=\\"case-reference\\">Case 21-2</span> is that the public welfare was best served by Engineer A reporting the public health, safety, and welfare concerns, even if the client did not wish for this to be done. This differs from the current case, not because public health, safety, and welfare is somehow less important now than in <span class=\\"case-reference\\">Case 21-2</span>, but because a project delivery process exists in this case by which it was accepted professional practice for Engineer A to complete the structural design, and rely on the contractor to handle safety aspects of construction. The Engineer A from <span class=\\"case-reference\\">Case 21-2</span> did not have this option.</p><p>Finally, there is <a href=\\"https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/professional-competence-current\\" target=\\"_blank\\">BER Case 02-5</a> where a third Engineer A, a structural engineer with experience in the design of structures in the region in which the current project is located, designed a structural system that Engineer A believed was sound and met applicable codes. However, new and improved design methods had recently been suggested in an article published in a technical journal, addressing new information regarding severe weather design in that region. Engineer A had not read that technical journal article. Within a year following construction, the building was damaged by severe weather conditions. It was determined that had the methods suggested in the technical articles been utilized in design, the damage would not have occurred. The BER concluded that it was not unethical for Engineer A to fail to follow methods suggested in a recent technical journal article that Engineer A had not reviewed. The BER indicated that they believed that the definition of what is “current practice” must be discerning and reasonable. The key finding from <span class=\\"case-reference\\">Case 02-5</span> was that engineers cannot be expected (obligated) to incorporate each and every new, innovative technique until such techniques are incorporated into generally accepted practice and become standards that should be followed. Engineer T (in the current case) and Engineer A (<span class=\\"case-reference\\">Case 02-5</span>) both followed accepted standard design practice. But these same engineers also had the opportunity (not obligation) to take the public welfare more firmly into account, to go above and beyond what was legally and ethically required. While they cannot be ethically faulted for not “going the extra mile” for the sake of the public health, safety, and welfare, the project outcomes likely would have been better if these engineers had done so. In hindsight, knowing the outcomes, the BER believes all parties would have wanted to at least consider the opportunity.</p><p>Collectively, the prior BER Cases reveal several principles to guide the engineer relative to the ethics of the situation. First, the engineer must hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public. Second, engineers must be competent in their areas of service. Third, engineers must be honest, and issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner. Fourth, the engineer must acknowledge their errors and not distort or alter the facts. These ethical obligations are required, and non-negotiable. So it is within this context that the engineer must determine how best to satisfy their obligations. The facts of the present case do not raise concerns about Engineer T’s competence in performing structural engineering design work. Further, Engineer T’s structural modification approach appears to have been straightforward, professionally designed, and properly presented in the construction documents. Not only this, but the design specifically mentions that the new structural connections were located in such a way that access was limited. These points demonstrate proper awareness and consideration of public safety, health, and welfare. When the design was completed, the facts imply Engineer T relied on the contractor to provide for worker safety during construction, and formally transferred this risk and responsibility via standard contractual language. Further, the facts indicate the contractor accepted the construction risk and responsibility without any question. On this basis, the facts do not suggest Engineer T made a design error. As with Engineer A in <span class=\\"case-reference\\">Case 97-13</span>, the fact that Engineer T (this present case) noticed after the accident that an alternative design approach could have prevented the worker injury does not mean that Engineer T was required to report this as an error.</p><p>But the question remains – similar to <span class=\\"case-reference\\">Case 21-2</span> and <span class=\\"case-reference\\">Case 02-5</span> – whether Engineer T did all that could have been done for worker safety?

On the legal/contractual side, many professional engineers familiar with construction contracts believe contract language sufficiently settles the matter. They point to standard construction contract provisions such as, “Contractor shall be solely responsible for the means, methods, techniques, sequences, and procedures of construction” (Engineers Joint Contract Documents Committee [EJCDC], C-700, Standard General Conditions of the Construction Contract, Article 7, Paragraph 7.01A). The construction contracts also include provisions identifying the Contractor’s sole responsibility for initiating, maintaining, and supervising all safety programs and precautions (Article 7, Paragraph 7.13A), for obtaining additional services as needed to carry out Contractor’s safety responsibilities (Article 7, Paragraph 7.01B), and for taking necessary precautions for safety and providing necessary protection to prevent damage, injury, or loss to all persons on the site who may be affected by the work (Article 7, Paragraph 7.13C). Through these legal/contractual mechanisms, risk and responsibility for worker safety during construction are formally transferred to the contractor, the contractor being the party best positioned to provide for project safety.  By this view, and with reference to the present case, the contractor is solely responsible for project safety, so Engineer T did not make any design error so long as the design met the professional standard of care (which the facts suggest it did).</p><p>But engineers must also consider the ethical perspective, and that is the primary area of concern for the Board of Ethical Review. Ethically, the facts of this case reveal a tension between the engineer doing what is professionally required, versus ”going above and beyond” in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare. The Board has considered this ethical tension in various ways over the years.</p><p><a href=\\"https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/duty-report-unrelated-information\\" target=\\"_blank\\">BER Case 97-13</a> introduces Engineer A, a civil engineer, who serves as a subconsultant to perform bridge inspection services on a major bridge overhaul project. Engineer A’s scope of work is solely to identify any pavement damage on the bridge and report the damage to its client, VWX Architects. While conducting the bridge inspection, and although not part of the scope of services for which he was retained, Engineer A notices an apparent pre-existing defective condition in a retaining wall which failed to restrain a vehicle, leading to a fatal accident involving Police Officer B. Engineer A surmises that the defective condition may have been a contributing factor in the wall failure and notes this in the engineering notes. Engineer A verbally reports this information to the client, which then verbally reports the information to the public agency. In finding it was ethical for Engineer A to retain the information in the engineering notes, but not include it in the final written report, the Board noted that Engineer A did the appropriate thing in coming forward to the client with the information and also by documenting the information for possible future reference as appropriate. But under the circumstances “it would have been improper for Engineer A to include reference to the information in his final report, particularly since it would have been based upon mere speculation and not careful testing or evaluation by a competent individual or firm.” In fact, the Board opined that had Engineer A formally “reported” the matter publicly, it would have been “an overreaction and could easily have risked jeopardizing the professional reputations of [Engineer A’s] client and the public agency.” The key finding from <span class=\\"case-reference\\">Case 97-13</span> is that the public welfare was best served by Engineer A exercising restraint in reporting. This parallels the current case, where Engineer A identified a safety risk in the design details, but per customary professional practice relied on the contractor (who had specific construction safety expertise) to address the issue. </p><p>A second example is <a href=\\"https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/public-health-safety-and-welfare-4\\" target=\\"_blank\\">BER Case 21-2</a>, where a second Engineer A serves as a consulting engineer representing Client B, a developer who is proposing to develop a healthcare facility that requires a significant upgrade to the property’s access road that crosses a tidal saltmarsh. Engineer A’s scope includes design and local permitting of the roadway, including an upgrade of the tidal crossing from a small culvert to a small bridge, increasing its hydraulic capacity. The local development regulations and national design codes and standards have not yet been updated to reflect changing conditions and weather patterns, including effects of sea level rise and changes in precipitation intensities and recurrence intervals effected by on-going climate change. It is Engineer A’s judgment, based on hydraulic evaluation procedures presented at a recent transportation agency conference, that the proposed project may result in some upstream homes becoming uninhabitable a decade or more earlier than would otherwise be the case. Engineer A proposes a complex and costly hydrologic and hydraulic analysis by a specialized subconsultant to predict the extent to which sea level rise and the increased hydraulic capacity of the tidal crossing will result in flood damage to a neighborhood of twenty upstream homes during future high tides and storm surges, anticipating this to be a difficult question to answer in the project’s public hearings. Client B directs Engineer A to proceed without the costly analysis unless and until such an analysis is requested by the applicable regulatory authorities. In this case, the BER found that “if Engineer A is reasonably certain that the project will result in adverse impacts to public health, safety, and welfare, and if the Client B denies the requisite evaluation, Engineer A should include the concern regarding potential adverse public health, safety, and welfare impacts in an engineering report for consideration by regulatory agencies and the public.” Thus, the key finding from <span class=\\"case-reference\\">Case 21-2</span> is that the public welfare was best served by Engineer A reporting the public health, safety, and welfare concerns, even if the client did not wish for this to be done. This differs from the current case, not because public health, safety, and welfare is somehow less important now than in <span class=\\"case-reference\\">Case 21-2</span>, but because a project delivery process exists in this case by which it was accepted professional practice for Engineer A to complete the structural design, and rely on the contractor to handle safety aspects of construction. The Engineer A from <span class=\\"case-reference\\">Case 21-2</span> did not have this option.</p><p>Finally, there is <a href=\\"https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/professional-competence-current\\" target=\\"_blank\\">BER Case 02-5</a> where a third Engineer A, a structural engineer with experience in the design of structures in the region in which the current project is located, designed a structural system that Engineer A believed was sound and met applicable codes. However, new and improved design methods had recently been suggested in an article published in a technical journal, addressing new information regarding severe weather design in that region. Engineer A had not read that technical journal article. Within a year following construction, the building was damaged by severe weather conditions. It was determined that had the methods suggested in the technical articles been utilized in design, the damage would not have occurred. The BER concluded that it was not unethical for Engineer A to fail to follow methods suggested in a recent technical journal article that Engineer A had not reviewed. The BER indicated that they believed that the definition of what is “current practice” must be discerning and reasonable. The key finding from <span class=\\"case-reference\\">Case 02-5</span> was that engineers cannot be expected (obligated) to incorporate each and every new, innovative technique until such techniques are incorporated into generally accepted practice and become standards that should be followed. Engineer T (in the current case) and Engineer A (<span class=\\"case-reference\\">Case 02-5</span>) both followed accepted standard design practice. But these same engineers also had the opportunity (not obligation) to take the public welfare more firmly into account, to go above and beyond what was legally and ethically required. While they cannot be ethically faulted for not “going the extra mile” for the sake of the public health, safety, and welfare, the project outcomes likely would have been better if these engineers had done so. In hindsight, knowing the outcomes, the BER believes all parties would have wanted to at least consider the opportunity.</p><p>Collectively, the prior BER Cases reveal several principles to guide the engineer relative to the ethics of the situation. First, the engineer must hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public. Second, engineers must be competent in their areas of service. Third, engineers must be honest, and issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner. Fourth, the engineer must acknowledge their errors and not distort or alter the facts. These ethical obligations are required, and non-negotiable. So it is within this context that the engineer must determine how best to satisfy their obligations. The facts of the present case do not raise concerns about Engineer T’s competence in performing structural engineering design work. Further, Engineer T’s structural modification approach appears to have been straightforward, professionally designed, and properly presented in the construction documents. Not only this, but the design specifically mentions that the new structural connections were located in such a way that access was limited. These points demonstrate proper awareness and consideration of public safety, health, and welfare. When the design was completed, the facts imply Engineer T relied on the contractor to provide for worker safety during construction, and formally transferred this risk and responsibility via standard contractual language. Further, the facts indicate the contractor accepted the construction risk and responsibility without any question. On this basis, the facts do not suggest Engineer T made a design error. As with Engineer A in <span class=\\"case-reference\\">Case 97-13</span>, the fact that Engineer T (this present case) noticed after the accident that an alternative design approach could have prevented the worker injury does not mean that Engineer T was required to report this as an error.</p><p>But the question remains – similar to <span class=\\"case-reference\\">Case 21-2</span> and <span class=\\"case-reference\\">Case 02-5</span> – whether Engineer T did all that could have been done for worker safety? After all, the solution approach Engineer T followed for this project did include an unusual and challenging construction aspect. Was it enough simply to call attention to this and shift safety responsibility to the contractor? <span class=\\"case-reference\\">Case 21-2</span> suggests it would have been ethically appropriate (an opportunity, not an obligation) for Engineer T to identify not just the straightforward design alternative, but also the more involved structural modification concept, to identify and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of both options, and to place these matters before the client and other members of the design team, possibly including the contractor, early in the process. Another option would have been for Engineer T to request a constructability review, or an independent construction safety review, or to inquire whether the contractor’s construction safety plan had flagged the heightened safety risk. If so, perhaps the issue would have been raised and alternatives might have been addressed. But Engineer T did not actively seek this input, and perhaps that is why Engineer T “felt some personal responsibility for the accident.”</p><p>But was this an “error?” Did Engineer T and/or Engineer B deviate from ethical engineering practice under the facts? The BER affirms the “ethical high road” of considering more than one design approach, and certainly the BER would agree with seeking critical input from construction safety professionals. But as in <span class=\\"case-reference\\">Case 02-5</span>, the BER does not view Engineer T’s design as unethical. While the construction accident and worker injury are tragic outcomes, because Engineer T’s design approach represented professional practice consistent with the standard of care, the BER sees this more as a missed opportunity than an ethical lapse and concludes that no “error” was made in design.</p><p>Was it ethical for Engineer T not to acknowledge an error after the accident occurred? The facts of this case and especially the discussion between Engineer T and Engineer B, as well as the legal/contractual perspective and ethical considerations outlined above, provide a rationale as to why Engineer T’s design was not an “error.” Because there was no error, Engineer T was not ethically obligated to acknowledge an error after the accident occurred. However, the BER believes this project was a missed opportunity for Engineer T to more fully and carefully hold paramount the public safety, health, and welfare.</p><p>The BER believes Engineer T should state that while no error was made, based on hindsight, other ways to approach the project existed which may have prevented the accident and worker injury. The view is consistent with ethics provisions that require engineers to be objective and truthful in professional reports, statements, or testimony; that engineers include all relevant and pertinent information, that they not distort or alter the facts, and avoid the use of statements containing a material misrepresentation of fact or omitting a material fact; and that they accept personal responsibility for their professional activities. Such conversation will not only allow Engineer T’s firm and others to benefit from lessons learned through this very difficult experience but will also promote continued professional development relative to projects of this type.  </p><p>Was it ethical for Engineer T not to acknowledge an error during the deposition? Again, using the same analysis presented above, the BER concludes that Engineer T’s design was not an “error.” Because there was no error, Engineer T was not ethically obligated to acknowledge an error during the deposition. Engineer T should respond clearly and honestly when questioned about the project, including T’s views on alternative design approaches vis-à-vis the public safety, health, and welfare, but should not characterize the work as a design error.</p>", "text": "This case addresses two ethical issues in engineering practice: to what extent are design engineers obligated to account for construction safety risks in their designs if they are not trained or have experience in construction safety methods, and are engineers obligated by the NSPE Code of Ethics to “acknowledge errors” when it is not clear an error has been made.\\nThe first issue, having to do with considering construction safety risks in the design, can be approached from both a legal/contractual (i.e., risk management) perspective and from an ethical perspective.

This differs from the current case, not because public health, safety, and welfare is somehow less important now than in Case 21-2 , but because a project delivery process exists in this case by which it was accepted professional practice for Engineer A to complete the structural design, and rely on the contractor to handle safety aspects of construction. The Engineer A from Case 21-2 did not have this option.\\nFinally, there is BER Case 02-5 where a third Engineer A, a structural engineer with experience in the design of structures in the region in which the current project is located, designed a structural system that Engineer A believed was sound and met applicable codes. However, new and improved design methods had recently been suggested in an article published in a technical journal, addressing new information regarding severe weather design in that region. Engineer A had not read that technical journal article. Within a year following construction, the building was damaged by severe weather conditions. It was determined that had the methods suggested in the technical articles been utilized in design, the damage would not have occurred. The BER concluded that it was not unethical for Engineer A to fail to follow methods suggested in a recent technical journal article that Engineer A had not reviewed. The BER indicated that they believed that the definition of what is “current practice” must be discerning and reasonable. The key finding from Case 02-5 was that engineers cannot be expected (obligated) to incorporate each and every new, innovative technique until such techniques are incorporated into generally accepted practice and become standards that should be followed. Engineer T (in the current case) and Engineer A ( Case 02-5 ) both followed accepted standard design practice. But these same engineers also had the opportunity (not obligation) to take the public welfare more firmly into account, to go above and beyond what was legally and ethically required. While they cannot be ethically faulted for not “going the extra mile” for the sake of the public health, safety, and welfare, the project outcomes likely would have been better if these engineers had done so. In hindsight, knowing the outcomes, the BER believes all parties would have wanted to at least consider the opportunity.\\nCollectively, the prior BER Cases reveal several principles to guide the engineer relative to the ethics of the situation. First, the engineer must hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public. Second, engineers must be competent in their areas of service. Third, engineers must be honest, and issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner. Fourth, the engineer must acknowledge their errors and not distort or alter the facts. These ethical obligations are required, and non-negotiable. So it is within this context that the engineer must determine how best to satisfy their obligations. The facts of the present case do not raise concerns about Engineer T’s competence in performing structural engineering design work. Further, Engineer T’s structural modification approach appears to have been straightforward, professionally designed, and properly presented in the construction documents. Not only this, but the design specifically mentions that the new structural connections were located in such a way that access was limited. These points demonstrate proper awareness and consideration of public safety, health, and welfare. When the design was completed, the facts imply Engineer T relied on the contractor to provide for worker safety during construction, and formally transferred this risk and responsibility via standard contractual language. Further, the facts indicate the contractor accepted the construction risk and responsibility without any question. On this basis, the facts do not suggest Engineer T made a design error. As with Engineer A in Case 97-13 , the fact that Engineer T (this present case) noticed after the accident that an alternative design approach could have prevented the worker injury does not mean that Engineer T was required to report this as an error.\\nBut the question remains – similar to Case 21-2 and Case 02-5 – whether Engineer T did all that could have been done for worker safety? After all, the solution approach Engineer T followed for this project did include an unusual and challenging construction aspect. Was it enough simply to call attention to this and shift safety responsibility to the contractor? Case 21-2 suggests it would have been ethically appropriate (an opportunity, not an obligation) for Engineer T to identify not just the straightforward design alternative, but also the more involved structural modification concept, to identify and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of both options, and to place these matters before the client and other members of the design team, possibly including the contractor, early in the process. Another option would have been for Engineer T to request a constructability review, or an independent construction safety review, or to inquire whether the contractor’s construction safety plan had flagged the heightened safety risk. If so, perhaps the issue would have been raised and alternatives might have been addressed. But Engineer T did not actively seek this input, and perhaps that is why Engineer T “felt some personal responsibility for the accident.”\\nBut was this an “error?” Did Engineer T and/or Engineer B deviate from ethical engineering practice under the facts? The BER affirms the “ethical high road” of considering more than one design approach, and certainly the BER would agree with seeking critical input from construction safety professionals. But as in Case 02-5 , the BER does not view Engineer T’s design as unethical. While the construction accident and worker injury are tragic outcomes, because Engineer T’s design approach represented professional practice consistent with the standard of care, the BER sees this more as a missed opportunity than an ethical lapse and concludes that no “error” was made in design.\\nWas it ethical for Engineer T not to acknowledge an error after the accident occurred? The facts of this case and especially the discussion between Engineer T and Engineer B, as well as the legal/contractual perspective and ethical considerations outlined above, provide a rationale as to why Engineer T’s design was not an “error.” Because there was no error, Engineer T was not ethically obligated to acknowledge an error after the accident occurred. However, the BER believes this project was a missed opportunity for Engineer T to more fully and carefully hold paramount the public safety, health, and welfare.\\nThe BER believes Engineer T should state that while no error was made, based on hindsight, other ways to approach the project existed which may have prevented the accident and worker injury. The view is consistent with ethics provisions that require engineers to be objective and truthful in professional reports, statements, or testimony; that engineers include all relevant and pertinent information, that they not distort or alter the facts, and avoid the use of statements containing a material misrepresentation of fact or omitting a material fact; and that they accept personal responsibility for their professional activities. Such conversation will not only allow Engineer T’s firm and others to benefit from lessons learned through this very difficult experience but will also promote continued professional development relative to projects of this type.\\nWas it ethical for Engineer T not to acknowledge an error during the deposition? Again, using the same analysis presented above, the BER concludes that Engineer T’s design was not an “error.” Because there was no error, Engineer T was not ethically obligated to acknowledge an error during the deposition. Engineer T should respond clearly and honestly when questioned about the project, including T’s views on alternative design approaches vis-à-vis the public safety, health, and welfare, but should not characterize the work as a design error."}, "references": {"html": "<div class=\\"field__items\\">\\n<div class=\\"field__item\\"><div>\\n<h2>\\n<div class=\\"field field--name-name field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item\\">I.1.</div>\\n</h2>\\n<div>\\n<div class=\\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-description field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\\"><p>Hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<div>Subject Reference</div>\\n<div class=\\"field__items\\">\\n<div class=\\"field__item\\"><a href=\\"https://www.nspe.org/categories/subject-reference-guide-code-ethics/duty-the-public\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Duty to the Public</a></div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\"field__item\\"><div>\\n<h2>\\n<div class=\\"field field--name-name field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item\\">I.2.</div>\\n</h2>\\n<div>\\n<div class=\\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-description field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\\"><p>Perform services only in areas of their competence.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<div>Subject Reference</div>\\n<div class=\\"field__items\\">\\n<div class=\\"field__item\\"><a href=\\"https://www.nspe.org/categories/subject-reference-guide-code-ethics/competence\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Competence</a></div>\\n<div class=\\"field__item\\"><a href=\\"https://www.nspe.org/categories/subject-reference-guide-code-ethics/qualifications-work\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Qualifications for Work</a></div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\"field__item\\"><div>\\n<h2>\\n<div class=\\"field field--name-name field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item\\">I.3.</div>\\n</h2>\\n<div>\\n<div class=\\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-description field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\\"><p>Issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<div>Subject Reference</div>\\n<div class=\\"field__items\\">\\n<div class=\\"field__item\\"><a href=\\"https://www.nspe.org/categories/subject-reference-guide-code-ethics/public-statements-and-criticism\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Public Statements and Criticism</a></div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\"field__item\\"><div>\\n<h2>\\n<div class=\\"field field--name-name field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item\\">I.4.</div>\\n</h2>\\n<div>\\n<div class=\\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-description field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\\"><p>Act for each employer or client as faithful agents or trustees.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<div>Subject Reference</div>\\n<div class=\\"field__items\\">\\n<div class=\\"field__item\\"><a href=\\"https://www.nspe.org/categories/subject-reference-guide-code-ethics/employer\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Employer</a></div>\\n<div class=\\"field__item\\"><a href=\\"https://www.nspe.org/categories/subject-reference-guide-code-ethics/faithful-agents-and-trustees\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Faithful Agents and Trustees</a></div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\"field__item\\"><div>\\n<h2>\\n<div class=\\"field field--name-name field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item\\">II.3.a.</div>\\n</h2>\\n<div>\\n<div class=\\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-description field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\\"><p>Engineers shall be objective and truthful in professional reports, statements, or testimony.

In establishing the project scope for the structural modifications, Engineer T selected a straightforward approach that required making structural connections immediately beneath floor level on an upper floor, in a tightly constrained space. Engineer T proceeded with the project per these parameters and did not explore alternative design approaches. Rather, Engineer T completed the design within the identified constraints and issued construction documents for the modifications.\\nThe new structural connections were located in such a way that access was limited, and the drawings clearly noted the constrained access. This design detail required the construction workers to make the connections in a contorted fashion. During construction, an accident occurred with a serious and permanent injury to a construction worker. Following the accident, Engineer T revisited the site and realized that had alternative design concepts been explored early on, the new structural modifications could have been proposed in a fundamentally different, more complex, but functionally equivalent way. The alternative approach would have been more costly and taken more time, but it would have allowed the construction workers to make all connections while standing on the floor such that injury would have been far less likely. Engineer T felt some personal responsibility for the accident.\\nEngineer T met with XYZ’s Chief Structural Engineer, Engineer B, explained the situation, and expressed a belief that a design error – i.e., not exploring alternative, safer design concepts – had been made and the NSPE Code of Ethics required that the error be acknowledged. Engineer B responded that Engineer T and XYZ Consulting Engineers had responded professionally to the design project, they had recommended a straightforward structural modification approach, and they were not expected or asked to consider alternative concepts. Further, Engineer T had specifically identified the constrained area of the new connections in the design documents, but because T was not trained in construction safety either by education (since civil engineering education typically does not include construction safety) or by specific experience (working for a construction contractor), Engineer T could not have reasonably known or assessed the level of worker safety risk posed by the connection location. The contractor had not raised questions regarding the construction safety risk or safer construction alternatives. Having thus thoughtfully considered the matter, both Engineer T and Engineer B decided that the situation did not merit acknowledgement of “an error.”\\nMonths later, after a construction claim had been submitted and a lawsuit had been filed, Engineer T met with attorneys representing XYZ and XYZ’s insurance company to prepare for a deposition of Engineer T. During preparation, Engineer T reviewed and discussed the project history, including the conversation with Engineer B relative to T’s feeling there was, potentially, a professional obligation to acknowledge an error – i.e., not exploring alternative, safer design concepts. Both of XYZ Consulting Engineers’ attorneys agreed that a clear obligation existed not to distort or alter any facts, and that Engineer T should respond to questions with complete transparency during the deposition. They pointed out, however, that whether an error was made was not up to Engineer T and was not clear in this set of circumstances, including for the reasons that Engineer B had indicated to Engineer T earlier. They also pointed out that one of the purposes of the legal process was to determine what errors might have been made and by whom, and what impact such errors might have had on the accident. The attorneys indicated that the legal process would determine whether, based on the facts, an error had been made, and that Engineer T should clearly report the facts, but should not voluntarily characterize the design work as an error.\\nIn the deposition, Engineer T responded factually to all questions regarding the design and the design process. Engineer T was not asked if an error had been made and did not offer an acknowledgement of a possible error.", "question": "Was it ethical for Engineer T and Engineer B to conclude an error had not been made in design?

On the legal/contractual side, many professional engineers familiar with construction contracts believe contract language sufficiently settles the matter. They point to standard construction contract provisions such as, “Contractor shall be solely responsible for the means, methods, techniques, sequences, and procedures of construction” (Engineers Joint Contract Documents Committee [EJCDC], C-700, Standard General Conditions of the Construction Contract, Article 7, Paragraph 7.01A). The construction contracts also include provisions identifying the Contractor’s sole responsibility for initiating, maintaining, and supervising all safety programs and precautions (Article 7, Paragraph 7.13A), for obtaining additional services as needed to carry out Contractor’s safety responsibilities (Article 7, Paragraph 7.01B), and for taking necessary precautions for safety and providing necessary protection to prevent damage, injury, or loss to all persons on the site who may be affected by the work (Article 7, Paragraph 7.13C). Through these legal/contractual mechanisms, risk and responsibility for worker safety during construction are formally transferred to the contractor, the contractor being the party best positioned to provide for project safety.  By this view, and with reference to the present case, the contractor is solely responsible for project safety, so Engineer T did not make any design error so long as the design met the professional standard of care (which the facts suggest it did).\\nBut engineers must also consider the ethical perspective, and that is the primary area of concern for the Board of Ethical Review. Ethically, the facts of this case reveal a tension between the engineer doing what is professionally required, versus ”going above and beyond” in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare. The Board has considered this ethical tension in various ways over the years.\\nBER Case 97-13 introduces Engineer A, a civil engineer, who serves as a subconsultant to perform bridge inspection services on a major bridge overhaul project. Engineer A’s scope of work is solely to identify any pavement damage on the bridge and report the damage to its client, VWX Architects. While conducting the bridge inspection, and although not part of the scope of services for which he was retained, Engineer A notices an apparent pre-existing defective condition in a retaining wall which failed to restrain a vehicle, leading to a fatal accident involving Police Officer B. Engineer A surmises that the defective condition may have been a contributing factor in the wall failure and notes this in the engineering notes. Engineer A verbally reports this information to the client, which then verbally reports the information to the public agency. In finding it was ethical for Engineer A to retain the information in the engineering notes, but not include it in the final written report, the Board noted that Engineer A did the appropriate thing in coming forward to the client with the information and also by documenting the information for possible future reference as appropriate. But under the circumstances “it would have been improper for Engineer A to include reference to the information in his final report, particularly since it would have been based upon mere speculation and not careful testing or evaluation by a competent individual or firm.” In fact, the Board opined that had Engineer A formally “reported” the matter publicly, it would have been “an overreaction and could easily have risked jeopardizing the professional reputations of [Engineer A’s] client and the public agency.” The key finding from Case 97-13 is that the public welfare was best served by Engineer A exercising restraint in reporting. This parallels the current case, where Engineer A identified a safety risk in the design details, but per customary professional practice relied on the contractor (who had specific construction safety expertise) to address the issue.\\nA second example is BER Case 21-2 , where a second Engineer A serves as a consulting engineer representing Client B, a developer who is proposing to develop a healthcare facility that requires a significant upgrade to the property’s access road that crosses a tidal saltmarsh. Engineer A’s scope includes design and local permitting of the roadway, including an upgrade of the tidal crossing from a small culvert to a small bridge, increasing its hydraulic capacity. The local development regulations and national design codes and standards have not yet been updated to reflect changing conditions and weather patterns, including effects of sea level rise and changes in precipitation intensities and recurrence intervals effected by on-going climate change. It is Engineer A’s judgment, based on hydraulic evaluation procedures presented at a recent transportation agency conference, that the proposed project may result in some upstream homes becoming uninhabitable a decade or more earlier than would otherwise be the case. Engineer A proposes a complex and costly hydrologic and hydraulic analysis by a specialized subconsultant to predict the extent to which sea level rise and the increased hydraulic capacity of the tidal crossing will result in flood damage to a neighborhood of twenty upstream homes during future high tides and storm surges, anticipating this to be a difficult question to answer in the project’s public hearings. Client B directs Engineer A to proceed without the costly analysis unless and until such an analysis is requested by the applicable regulatory authorities. In this case, the BER found that “if Engineer A is reasonably certain that the project will result in adverse impacts to public health, safety, and welfare, and if the Client B denies the requisite evaluation, Engineer A should include the concern regarding potential adverse public health, safety, and welfare impacts in an engineering report for consideration by regulatory agencies and the public.” Thus, the key finding from Case 21-2 is that the public welfare was best served by Engineer A reporting the public health, safety, and welfare concerns, even if the client did not wish for this to be done. This differs from the current case, not because public health, safety, and welfare is somehow less important now than in Case 21-2 , but because a project delivery process exists in this case by which it was accepted professional practice for Engineer A to complete the structural design, and rely on the contractor to handle safety aspects of construction. The Engineer A from Case 21-2 did not have this option.\\nFinally, there is BER Case 02-5 where a third Engineer A, a structural engineer with experience in the design of structures in the region in which the current project is located, designed a structural system that Engineer A believed was sound and met applicable codes. However, new and improved design methods had recently been suggested in an article published in a technical journal, addressing new information regarding severe weather design in that region. Engineer A had not read that technical journal article. Within a year following construction, the building was damaged by severe weather conditions. It was determined that had the methods suggested in the technical articles been utilized in design, the damage would not have occurred. The BER concluded that it was not unethical for Engineer A to fail to follow methods suggested in a recent technical journal article that Engineer A had not reviewed. The BER indicated that they believed that the definition of what is “current practice” must be discerning and reasonable. The key finding from Case 02-5 was that engineers cannot be expected (obligated) to incorporate each and every new, innovative technique until such techniques are incorporated into generally accepted practice and become standards that should be followed. Engineer T (in the current case) and Engineer A ( Case 02-5 ) both followed accepted standard design practice. But these same engineers also had the opportunity (not obligation) to take the public welfare more firmly into account, to go above and beyond what was legally and ethically required. While they cannot be ethically faulted for not “going the extra mile” for the sake of the public health, safety, and welfare, the project outcomes likely would have been better if these engineers had done so. In hindsight, knowing the outcomes, the BER believes all parties would have wanted to at least consider the opportunity.\\nCollectively, the prior BER Cases reveal several principles to guide the engineer relative to the ethics of the situation. First, the engineer must hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public. Second, engineers must be competent in their areas of service. Third, engineers must be honest, and issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner. Fourth, the engineer must acknowledge their errors and not distort or alter the facts. These ethical obligations are required, and non-negotiable. So it is within this context that the engineer must determine how best to satisfy their obligations. The facts of the present case do not raise concerns about Engineer T’s competence in performing structural engineering design work. Further, Engineer T’s structural modification approach appears to have been straightforward, professionally designed, and properly presented in the construction documents. Not only this, but the design specifically mentions that the new structural connections were located in such a way that access was limited. These points demonstrate proper awareness and consideration of public safety, health, and welfare. When the design was completed, the facts imply Engineer T relied on the contractor to provide for worker safety during construction, and formally transferred this risk and responsibility via standard contractual language. Further, the facts indicate the contractor accepted the construction risk and responsibility without any question. On this basis, the facts do not suggest Engineer T made a design error. As with Engineer A in Case 97-13 , the fact that Engineer T (this present case) noticed after the accident that an alternative design approach could have prevented the worker injury does not mean that Engineer T was required to report this as an error.\\nBut the question remains – similar to Case 21-2 and Case 02-5 – whether Engineer T did all that could have been done for worker safety? After all, the solution approach Engineer T followed for this project did include an unusual and challenging construction aspect. Was it enough simply to call attention to this and shift safety responsibility to the contractor? Case 21-2 suggests it would have been ethically appropriate (an opportunity, not an obligation) for Engineer T to identify not just the straightforward design alternative, but also the more involved structural modification concept, to identify and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of both options, and to place these matters before the client and other members of the design team, possibly including the contractor, early in the process. Another option would have been for Engineer T to request a constructability review, or an independent construction safety review, or to inquire whether the contractor’s construction safety plan had flagged the heightened safety risk. If so, perhaps the issue would have been raised and alternatives might have been addressed. But Engineer T did not actively seek this input, and perhaps that is why Engineer T “felt some personal responsibility for the accident.”\\nBut was this an “error?” Did Engineer T and/or Engineer B deviate from ethical engineering practice under the facts? The BER affirms the “ethical high road” of considering more than one design approach, and certainly the BER would agree with seeking critical input from construction safety professionals. But as in Case 02-5 , the BER does not view Engineer T’s design as unethical. While the construction accident and worker injury are tragic outcomes, because Engineer T’s design approach represented professional practice consistent with the standard of care, the BER sees this more as a missed opportunity than an ethical lapse and concludes that no “error” was made in design.\\nWas it ethical for Engineer T not to acknowledge an error after the accident occurred? The facts of this case and especially the discussion between Engineer T and Engineer B, as well as the legal/contractual perspective and ethical considerations outlined above, provide a rationale as to why Engineer T’s design was not an “error.” Because there was no error, Engineer T was not ethically obligated to acknowledge an error after the accident occurred. However, the BER believes this project was a missed opportunity for Engineer T to more fully and carefully hold paramount the public safety, health, and welfare.\\nThe BER believes Engineer T should state that while no error was made, based on hindsight, other ways to approach the project existed which may have prevented the accident and worker injury. The view is consistent with ethics provisions that require engineers to be objective and truthful in professional reports, statements, or testimony; that engineers include all relevant and pertinent information, that they not distort or alter the facts, and avoid the use of statements containing a material misrepresentation of fact or omitting a material fact; and that they accept personal responsibility for their professional activities. Such conversation will not only allow Engineer T’s firm and others to benefit from lessons learned through this very difficult experience but will also promote continued professional development relative to projects of this type.\\nWas it ethical for Engineer T not to acknowledge an error during the deposition? Again, using the same analysis presented above, the BER concludes that Engineer T’s design was not an “error.” Because there was no error, Engineer T was not ethically obligated to acknowledge an error during the deposition. Engineer T should respond clearly and honestly when questioned about the project, including T’s views on alternative design approaches vis-à-vis the public safety, health, and welfare, but should not characterize the work as a design error.", "references": "I.1.

In establishing the project scope for the structural modifications, Engineer T selected a straightforward approach that required making structural connections immediately beneath floor level on an upper floor, in a tightly constrained space. Engineer T proceeded with the project per these parameters and did not explore alternative design approaches. Rather, Engineer T completed the design within the identified constraints and issued construction documents for the modifications.The new structural connections were located in such a way that access was limited, and the drawings clearly noted the constrained access. This design detail required the construction workers to make the connections in a contorted fashion. During construction, an accident occurred with a serious and permanent injury to a construction worker. Following the accident, Engineer T revisited the site and realized that had alternative design concepts been explored early on, the new structural modifications could have been proposed in a fundamentally different, more complex, but functionally equivalent way. The alternative approach would have been more costly and taken more time, but it would have allowed the construction workers to make all connections while standing on the floor such that injury would have been far less likely. Engineer T felt some personal responsibility for the accident.Engineer T met with XYZ’s Chief Structural Engineer, Engineer B, explained the situation, and expressed a belief that a design error – i.e., not exploring alternative, safer design concepts – had been made and the NSPE Code of Ethics required that the error be acknowledged. Engineer B responded that Engineer T and XYZ Consulting Engineers had responded professionally to the design project, they had recommended a straightforward structural modification approach, and they were not expected or asked to consider alternative concepts. Further, Engineer T had specifically identified the constrained area of the new connections in the design documents, but because T was not trained in construction safety either by education (since civil engineering education typically does not include construction safety) or by specific experience (working for a construction contractor), Engineer T could not have reasonably known or assessed the level of worker safety risk posed by the connection location. The contractor had not raised questions regarding the construction safety risk or safer construction alternatives. Having thus thoughtfully considered the matter, both Engineer T and Engineer B decided that the situation did not merit acknowledgement of “an error.”Months later, after a construction claim had been submitted and a lawsuit had been filed, Engineer T met with attorneys representing XYZ and XYZ’s insurance company to prepare for a deposition of Engineer T. During preparation, Engineer T reviewed and discussed the project history, including the conversation with Engineer B relative to T’s feeling there was, potentially, a professional obligation to acknowledge an error – i.e., not exploring alternative, safer design concepts. Both of XYZ Consulting Engineers’ attorneys agreed that a clear obligation existed not to distort or alter any facts, and that Engineer T should respond to questions with complete transparency during the deposition. They pointed out, however, that whether an error was made was not up to Engineer T and was not clear in this set of circumstances, including for the reasons that Engineer B had indicated to Engineer T earlier. They also pointed out that one of the purposes of the legal process was to determine what errors might have been made and by whom, and what impact such errors might have had on the accident. The attorneys indicated that the legal process would determine whether, based on the facts, an error had been made, and that Engineer T should clearly report the facts, but should not voluntarily characterize the design work as an error.In the deposition, Engineer T responded factually to all questions regarding the design and the design process.

On the legal/contractual side, many professional engineers familiar with construction contracts believe contract language sufficiently settles the matter. They point to standard construction contract provisions such as, “Contractor shall be solely responsible for the means, methods, techniques, sequences, and procedures of construction” (Engineers Joint Contract Documents Committee [EJCDC], C-700, Standard General Conditions of the Construction Contract, Article 7, Paragraph 7.01A). The construction contracts also include provisions identifying the Contractor’s sole responsibility for initiating, maintaining, and supervising all safety programs and precautions (Article 7, Paragraph 7.13A), for obtaining additional services as needed to carry out Contractor’s safety responsibilities (Article 7, Paragraph 7.01B), and for taking necessary precautions for safety and providing necessary protection to prevent damage, injury, or loss to all persons on the site who may be affected by the work (Article 7, Paragraph 7.13C). Through these legal/contractual mechanisms, risk and responsibility for worker safety during construction are formally transferred to the contractor, the contractor being the party best positioned to provide for project safety.  By this view, and with reference to the present case, the contractor is solely responsible for project safety, so Engineer T did not make any design error so long as the design met the professional standard of care (which the facts suggest it did).</p><p>But engineers must also consider the ethical perspective, and that is the primary area of concern for the Board of Ethical Review. Ethically, the facts of this case reveal a tension between the engineer doing what is professionally required, versus ”going above and beyond” in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare. The Board has considered this ethical tension in various ways over the years.</p><p><a href=\\"https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/duty-report-unrelated-information\\" target=\\"_blank\\">BER Case 97-13</a> introduces Engineer A, a civil engineer, who serves as a subconsultant to perform bridge inspection services on a major bridge overhaul project. Engineer A’s scope of work is solely to identify any pavement damage on the bridge and report the damage to its client, VWX Architects. While conducting the bridge inspection, and although not part of the scope of services for which he was retained, Engineer A notices an apparent pre-existing defective condition in a retaining wall which failed to restrain a vehicle, leading to a fatal accident involving Police Officer B. Engineer A surmises that the defective condition may have been a contributing factor in the wall failure and notes this in the engineering notes. Engineer A verbally reports this information to the client, which then verbally reports the information to the public agency. In finding it was ethical for Engineer A to retain the information in the engineering notes, but not include it in the final written report, the Board noted that Engineer A did the appropriate thing in coming forward to the client with the information and also by documenting the information for possible future reference as appropriate. But under the circumstances “it would have been improper for Engineer A to include reference to the information in his final report, particularly since it would have been based upon mere speculation and not careful testing or evaluation by a competent individual or firm.” In fact, the Board opined that had Engineer A formally “reported” the matter publicly, it would have been “an overreaction and could easily have risked jeopardizing the professional reputations of [Engineer A’s] client and the public agency.” The key finding from <span class=\\"case-reference\\">Case 97-13</span> is that the public welfare was best served by Engineer A exercising restraint in reporting. This parallels the current case, where Engineer A identified a safety risk in the design details, but per customary professional practice relied on the contractor (who had specific construction safety expertise) to address the issue. </p><p>A second example is <a href=\\"https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/public-health-safety-and-welfare-4\\" target=\\"_blank\\">BER Case 21-2</a>, where a second Engineer A serves as a consulting engineer representing Client B, a developer who is proposing to develop a healthcare facility that requires a significant upgrade to the property’s access road that crosses a tidal saltmarsh.

The local development regulations and national design codes and standards have not yet been updated to reflect changing conditions and weather patterns, including effects of sea level rise and changes in precipitation intensities and recurrence intervals effected by on-going climate change.

On the legal/contractual side, many professional engineers familiar with construction contracts believe contract language sufficiently settles the matter. They point to standard construction contract provisions such as, “Contractor shall be solely responsible for the means, methods, techniques, sequences, and procedures of construction” (Engineers Joint Contract Documents Committee [EJCDC], C-700, Standard General Conditions of the Construction Contract, Article 7, Paragraph 7.01A). The construction contracts also include provisions identifying the Contractor’s sole responsibility for initiating, maintaining, and supervising all safety programs and precautions (Article 7, Paragraph 7.13A), for obtaining additional services as needed to carry out Contractor’s safety responsibilities (Article 7, Paragraph 7.01B), and for taking necessary precautions for safety and providing necessary protection to prevent damage, injury, or loss to all persons on the site who may be affected by the work (Article 7, Paragraph 7.13C). Through these legal/contractual mechanisms, risk and responsibility for worker safety during construction are formally transferred to the contractor, the contractor being the party best positioned to provide for project safety.  By this view, and with reference to the present case, the contractor is solely responsible for project safety, so Engineer T did not make any design error so long as the design met the professional standard of care (which the facts suggest it did).\\" ;\\n    proethica:isPartOf <http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/discussion> .\\n\\n<http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/discussion_segment_3> a proethica:DiscussionSegment,\\n        owl:NamedIndividual ;\\n    proethica:hasSegmentType \\"ethical_analysis\\" ;\\n    proethica:hasSequenceNumber 4 ;\\n    proethica:hasTextContent \\"But engineers must also consider the ethical perspective, and that is the primary area of concern for the Board of Ethical Review.

Engineer A’s scope of work is solely to identify any pavement damage on the bridge and report the damage to its client, VWX Architects. While conducting the bridge inspection, and although not part of the scope of services for which he was retained, Engineer A notices an apparent pre-existing defective condition in a retaining wall which failed to restrain a vehicle, leading to a fatal accident involving Police Officer B. Engineer A surmises that the defective condition may have been a contributing factor in the wall failure and notes this in the engineering notes. Engineer A verbally reports this information to the client, which then verbally reports the information to the public agency. In finding it was ethical for Engineer A to retain the information in the engineering notes, but not include it in the final written report, the Board noted that Engineer A did the appropriate thing in coming forward to the client with the information and also by documenting the information for possible future reference as appropriate. But under the circumstances “it would have been improper for Engineer A to include reference to the information in his final report, particularly since it would have been based upon mere speculation and not careful testing or evaluation by a competent individual or firm.” In fact, the Board opined that had Engineer A formally “reported” the matter publicly, it would have been “an overreaction and could easily have risked jeopardizing the professional reputations of [Engineer A’s] client and the public agency.” The key finding from Case 97-13 is that the public welfare was best served by Engineer A exercising restraint in reporting. This parallels the current case, where Engineer A identified a safety risk in the design details, but per customary professional practice relied on the contractor (who had specific construction safety expertise) to address the issue.\\" ;\\n    proethica:isPartOf <http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/discussion> .\\n\\n<http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/discussion_segment_5> a proethica:DiscussionSegment,\\n        owl:NamedIndividual ;\\n    proethica:hasSegmentType \\"ethical_analysis\\" ;\\n    proethica:hasSequenceNumber 6 ;\\n    proethica:hasTextContent \\"A second example is BER Case 21-2, where a second Engineer A serves as a consulting engineer representing Client B, a developer who is proposing to develop a healthcare facility that requires a significant upgrade to the property’s access road that crosses a tidal saltmarsh. Engineer A’s scope includes design and local permitting of the roadway, including an upgrade of the tidal crossing from a small culvert to a small bridge, increasing its hydraulic capacity. The local development regulations and national design codes and standards have not yet been updated to reflect changing conditions and weather patterns, including effects of sea level rise and changes in precipitation intensities and recurrence intervals effected by on-going climate change. It is Engineer A’s judgment, based on hydraulic evaluation procedures presented at a recent transportation agency conference, that the proposed project may result in some upstream homes becoming uninhabitable a decade or more earlier than would otherwise be the case. Engineer A proposes a complex and costly hydrologic and hydraulic analysis by a specialized subconsultant to predict the extent to which sea level rise and the increased hydraulic capacity of the tidal crossing will result in flood damage to a neighborhood of twenty upstream homes during future high tides and storm surges, anticipating this to be a difficult question to answer in the project’s public hearings. Client B directs Engineer A to proceed without the costly analysis unless and until such an analysis is requested by the applicable regulatory authorities. In this case, the BER found that “if Engineer A is reasonably certain that the project will result in adverse impacts to public health, safety, and welfare, and if the Client B denies the requisite evaluation, Engineer A should include the concern regarding potential adverse public health, safety, and welfare impacts in an engineering report for consideration by regulatory agencies and the public.” Thus, the key finding from Case 21-2 is that the public welfare was best served by Engineer A reporting the public health, safety, and welfare concerns, even if the client did not wish for this to be done. This differs from the current case, not because public health, safety, and welfare is somehow less important now than in Case 21-2, but because a project delivery process exists in this case by which it was accepted professional practice for Engineer A to complete the structural design, and rely on the contractor to handle safety aspects of construction. The Engineer A from Case 21-2 did not have this option.\\" ;\\n    proethica:isPartOf <http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/discussion> .\\n\\n<http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/discussion_segment_6> a proethica:DiscussionSegment,\\n        owl:NamedIndividual ;\\n    proethica:hasSegmentType \\"ethical_analysis\\" ;\\n    proethica:hasSequenceNumber 7 ;\\n    proethica:hasTextContent \\"Finally, there is BER Case 02-5 where a third Engineer A, a structural engineer with experience in the design of structures in the region in which the current project is located, designed a structural system that Engineer A believed was sound and met applicable codes. However, new and improved design methods had recently been suggested in an article published in a technical journal, addressing new information regarding severe weather design in that region. Engineer A had not read that technical journal article. Within a year following construction, the building was damaged by severe weather conditions. It was determined that had the methods suggested in the technical articles been utilized in design, the damage would not have occurred. The BER concluded that it was not unethical for Engineer A to fail to follow methods suggested in a recent technical journal article that Engineer A had not reviewed. The BER indicated that they believed that the definition of what is “current practice” must be discerning and reasonable. The key finding from Case 02-5 was that engineers cannot be expected (obligated) to incorporate each and every new, innovative technique until such techniques are incorporated into generally accepted practice and become standards that should be followed. Engineer T (in the current case) and Engineer A (Case 02-5) both followed accepted standard design practice. But these same engineers also had the opportunity (not obligation) to take the public welfare more firmly into account, to go above and beyond what was legally and ethically required. While they cannot be ethically faulted for not “going the extra mile” for the sake of the public health, safety, and welfare, the project outcomes likely would have been better if these engineers had done so. In hindsight, knowing the outcomes, the BER believes all parties would have wanted to at least consider the opportunity.\\" ;\\n    proethica:isPartOf <http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/discussion> .\\n\\n<http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/discussion_segment_7> a proethica:DiscussionSegment,\\n        owl:NamedIndividual ;\\n    proethica:hasSegmentType \\"ethical_analysis\\" ;\\n    proethica:hasSequenceNumber 8 ;\\n    proethica:hasTextContent \\"Collectively, the prior BER Cases reveal several principles to guide the engineer relative to the ethics of the situation. First, the engineer must hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public. Second, engineers must be competent in their areas of service. Third, engineers must be honest, and issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner. Fourth, the engineer must acknowledge their errors and not distort or alter the facts. These ethical obligations are required, and non-negotiable. So it is within this context that the engineer must determine how best to satisfy their obligations. The facts of the present case do not raise concerns about Engineer T’s competence in performing structural engineering design work. Further, Engineer T’s structural modification approach appears to have been straightforward, professionally designed, and properly presented in the construction documents. Not only this, but the design specifically mentions that the new structural connections were located in such a way that access was limited. These points demonstrate proper awareness and consideration of public safety, health, and welfare. When the design was completed, the facts imply Engineer T relied on the contractor to provide for worker safety during construction, and formally transferred this risk and responsibility via standard contractual language. Further, the facts indicate the contractor accepted the construction risk and responsibility without any question. On this basis, the facts do not suggest Engineer T made a design error. As with Engineer A in Case 97-13, the fact that Engineer T (this present case) noticed after the accident that an alternative design approach could have prevented the worker injury does not mean that Engineer T was required to report this as an error.\\" ;\\n    proethica:isPartOf <http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/discussion> .\\n\\n<http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/discussion_segment_8> a proethica:DiscussionSegment,\\n        owl:NamedIndividual ;\\n    proethica:hasSegmentType \\"ethical_analysis\\" ;\\n    proethica:hasSequenceNumber 9 ;\\n    proethica:hasTextContent \\"But the question remains – similar to Case 21-2 and Case 02-5 – whether Engineer T did all that could have been done for worker safety? After all, the solution approach Engineer T followed for this project did include an unusual and challenging construction aspect. Was it enough simply to call attention to this and shift safety responsibility to the contractor? Case 21-2 suggests it would have been ethically appropriate (an opportunity, not an obligation) for Engineer T to identify not just the straightforward design alternative, but also the more involved structural modification concept, to identify and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of both options, and to place these matters before the client and other members of the design team, possibly including the contractor, early in the process. Another option would have been for Engineer T to request a constructability review, or an independent construction safety review, or to inquire whether the contractor’s construction safety plan had flagged the heightened safety risk. If so, perhaps the issue would have been raised and alternatives might have been addressed. But Engineer T did not actively seek this input, and perhaps that is why Engineer T “felt some personal responsibility for the accident.”\\" ;\\n    proethica:isPartOf <http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/discussion> .\\n\\n<http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/discussion_segment_9> a proethica:DiscussionSegment,\\n        owl:NamedIndividual ;\\n    proethica:hasSegmentType \\"ethical_analysis\\" ;\\n    proethica:hasSequenceNumber 10 ;\\n    proethica:hasTextContent \\"But was this an “error?” Did Engineer T and/or Engineer B deviate from ethical engineering practice under the facts? The BER affirms the “ethical high road” of considering more than one design approach, and certainly the BER would agree with seeking critical input from construction safety professionals. But as in Case 02-5, the BER does not view Engineer T’s design as unethical. While the construction accident and worker injury are tragic outcomes, because Engineer T’s design approach represented professional practice consistent with the standard of care, the BER sees this more as a missed opportunity than an ethical lapse and concludes that no “error” was made in design.\\" ;\\n    proethica:isPartOf <http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/discussion> .\\n\\n<http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/fact_1> a proethica:FactStatement,\\n        owl:NamedIndividual ;\\n    proethica:hasSequenceNumber 1 ;\\n    proethica:hasTextContent \\"Engineer T, a senior structural engineer who designs commercial buildings in the employ of XYZ Consulting Engineers, was in responsible charge of the design of major structural modifications to an existing building.\\" ;\\n    proethica:isPartOf <http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/facts> .\\n\\n<http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/fact_10> a proethica:FactStatement,\\n        owl:NamedIndividual ;\\n    proethica:hasSequenceNumber 10 ;\\n    proethica:hasTextContent \\"Engineer T met with XYZ’s Chief Structural Engineer, Engineer B, explained the situation, and expressed a belief that a design error – i.e., not exploring alternative, safer design concepts – had been made and the NSPE Code of Ethics required that the error be acknowledged.\\" ;\\n    proethica:isPartOf <http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/facts> .\\n\\n<http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/fact_11> a proethica:FactStatement,\\n        owl:NamedIndividual ;\\n    proethica:hasSequenceNumber 11 ;\\n    proethica:hasTextContent \\"Engineer B responded that Engineer T and XYZ Consulting Engineers had responded professionally to the design project, they had recommended a straightforward structural modification approach, and they were not expected or asked to consider alternative concepts.\\" ;\\n    proethica:isPartOf <http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/facts> .\\n\\n<http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/fact_12> a proethica:FactStatement,\\n        owl:NamedIndividual ;\\n    proethica:hasSequenceNumber 12 ;\\n    proethica:hasTextContent \\"Further, Engineer T had specifically identified the constrained area of the new connections in the design documents, but because T was not trained in construction safety either by education (since civil engineering education typically does not include construction safety) or by specific experience (working for a construction contractor), Engineer T could not have reasonably known or assessed the level of worker safety risk posed by the connection location.\\" ;\\n    proethica:isPartOf <http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/facts> .\\n\\n<http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/fact_13> a proethica:FactStatement,\\n        owl:NamedIndividual ;\\n    proethica:hasSequenceNumber 13 ;\\n    proethica:hasTextContent \\"The contractor had not raised questions regarding the construction safety risk or safer construction alternatives.\\" ;\\n    proethica:isPartOf <http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/facts> .\\n\\n<http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/fact_14> a proethica:FactStatement,\\n        owl:NamedIndividual ;\\n    proethica:hasSequenceNumber 14 ;\\n    proethica:hasTextContent \\"\\"\\"Having thus thoughtfully considered the matter, both Engineer T and Engineer B decided that the situation did not merit acknowledgement of “an error.”\\nMonths later, after a construction claim had been submitted and a lawsuit had been filed, Engineer T met with attorneys representing XYZ and XYZ’s insurance company to prepare for a deposition of Engineer T.\\"\\"\\" ;\\n    proethica:isPartOf <http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/facts> .\\n\\n<http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/fact_15> a proethica:FactStatement,\\n        owl:NamedIndividual ;\\n    proethica:hasSequenceNumber 15 ;\\n    proethica:hasTextContent \\"During preparation, Engineer T reviewed and discussed the project history, including the conversation with Engineer B relative to T’s feeling there was, potentially, a professional obligation to acknowledge an error – i.e., not exploring alternative, safer design concepts.\\" ;\\n    proethica:isPartOf <http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/facts> .\\n\\n<http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/fact_16> a proethica:FactStatement,\\n        owl:NamedIndividual ;\\n    proethica:hasSequenceNumber 16 ;\\n    proethica:hasTextContent \\"Both of XYZ Consulting Engineers’ attorneys agreed that a clear obligation existed not to distort or alter any facts, and that Engineer T should respond to questions with complete transparency during the deposition.

It was ethical for Engineer T to refrain from acknowledging an error during the deposition because there was no error.  Engineer T should respond clearly and honestly when questioned about the project, including views on alternative design approaches vis-à-vis the public safety, health, and welfare, but should not characterize the work as a design error.\\"\\"\\" ;\\n    proethica:isPartOf <http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4> .\\n\\n<http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/questions> a proethica:QuestionsSection,\\n        owl:NamedIndividual ;\\n    proethica:followsInDocument <http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/facts> ;\\n    proethica:hasHtmlContent \\"Was it ethical for Engineer T and Engineer B to conclude an error had not been made in design?Was it ethical for Engineer T not to acknowledge an error after the accident occurred?Was it ethical for Engineer T not to acknowledge an error during the deposition?\\" ;\\n    proethica:hasPart <http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/question_1>,\\n        <http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/question_2>,\\n        <http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/question_3> ;\\n    proethica:hasTextContent \\"\\"\\"Was it ethical for Engineer T and Engineer B to conclude an error had not been made in design?

On the legal/contractual side, many professional engineers familiar with construction contracts believe contract language sufficiently settles the matter. They point to standard construction contract provisions such as, “Contractor shall be solely responsible for the means, methods, techniques, sequences, and procedures of construction” (Engineers Joint Contract Documents Committee [EJCDC], C-700, Standard General Conditions of the Construction Contract, Article 7, Paragraph 7.01A). The construction contracts also include provisions identifying the Contractor’s sole responsibility for initiating, maintaining, and supervising all safety programs and precautions (Article 7, Paragraph 7.13A), for obtaining additional services as needed to carry out Contractor’s safety responsibilities (Article 7, Paragraph 7.01B), and for taking necessary precautions for safety and providing necessary protection to prevent damage, injury, or loss to all persons on the site who may be affected by the work (Article 7, Paragraph 7.13C). Through these legal/contractual mechanisms, risk and responsibility for worker safety during construction are formally transferred to the contractor, the contractor being the party best positioned to provide for project safety.  By this view, and with reference to the present case, the contractor is solely responsible for project safety, so Engineer T did not make any design error so long as the design met the professional standard of care (which the facts suggest it did).</p><p>But engineers must also consider the ethical perspective, and that is the primary area of concern for the Board of Ethical Review. Ethically, the facts of this case reveal a tension between the engineer doing what is professionally required, versus ”going above and beyond” in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare. The Board has considered this ethical tension in various ways over the years.</p><p><a href=\\\\\\"https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/duty-report-unrelated-information\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\">BER Case 97-13</a> introduces Engineer A, a civil engineer, who serves as a subconsultant to perform bridge inspection services on a major bridge overhaul project. Engineer A’s scope of work is solely to identify any pavement damage on the bridge and report the damage to its client, VWX Architects. While conducting the bridge inspection, and although not part of the scope of services for which he was retained, Engineer A notices an apparent pre-existing defective condition in a retaining wall which failed to restrain a vehicle, leading to a fatal accident involving Police Officer B. Engineer A surmises that the defective condition may have been a contributing factor in the wall failure and notes this in the engineering notes. Engineer A verbally reports this information to the client, which then verbally reports the information to the public agency. In finding it was ethical for Engineer A to retain the information in the engineering notes, but not include it in the final written report, the Board noted that Engineer A did the appropriate thing in coming forward to the client with the information and also by documenting the information for possible future reference as appropriate. But under the circumstances “it would have been improper for Engineer A to include reference to the information in his final report, particularly since it would have been based upon mere speculation and not careful testing or evaluation by a competent individual or firm.” In fact, the Board opined that had Engineer A formally “reported” the matter publicly, it would have been “an overreaction and could easily have risked jeopardizing the professional reputations of [Engineer A’s] client and the public agency.” The key finding from <span class=\\\\\\"case-reference\\\\\\">Case 97-13</span> is that the public welfare was best served by Engineer A exercising restraint in reporting. This parallels the current case, where Engineer A identified a safety risk in the design details, but per customary professional practice relied on the contractor (who had specific construction safety expertise) to address the issue. </p><p>A second example is <a href=\\\\\\"https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/public-health-safety-and-welfare-4\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\">BER Case 21-2</a>, where a second Engineer A serves as a consulting engineer representing Client B, a developer who is proposing to develop a healthcare facility that requires a significant upgrade to the property’s access road that crosses a tidal saltmarsh. Engineer A’s scope includes design and local permitting of the roadway, including an upgrade of the tidal crossing from a small culvert to a small bridge, increasing its hydraulic capacity. The local development regulations and national design codes and standards have not yet been updated to reflect changing conditions and weather patterns, including effects of sea level rise and changes in precipitation intensities and recurrence intervals effected by on-going climate change. It is Engineer A’s judgment, based on hydraulic evaluation procedures presented at a recent transportation agency conference, that the proposed project may result in some upstream homes becoming uninhabitable a decade or more earlier than would otherwise be the case. Engineer A proposes a complex and costly hydrologic and hydraulic analysis by a specialized subconsultant to predict the extent to which sea level rise and the increased hydraulic capacity of the tidal crossing will result in flood damage to a neighborhood of twenty upstream homes during future high tides and storm surges, anticipating this to be a difficult question to answer in the project’s public hearings. Client B directs Engineer A to proceed without the costly analysis unless and until such an analysis is requested by the applicable regulatory authorities. In this case, the BER found that “if Engineer A is reasonably certain that the project will result in adverse impacts to public health, safety, and welfare, and if the Client B denies the requisite evaluation, Engineer A should include the concern regarding potential adverse public health, safety, and welfare impacts in an engineering report for consideration by regulatory agencies and the public.” Thus, the key finding from <span class=\\\\\\"case-reference\\\\\\">Case 21-2</span> is that the public welfare was best served by Engineer A reporting the public health, safety, and welfare concerns, even if the client did not wish for this to be done. This differs from the current case, not because public health, safety, and welfare is somehow less important now than in <span class=\\\\\\"case-reference\\\\\\">Case 21-2</span>, but because a project delivery process exists in this case by which it was accepted professional practice for Engineer A to complete the structural design, and rely on the contractor to handle safety aspects of construction. The Engineer A from <span class=\\\\\\"case-reference\\\\\\">Case 21-2</span> did not have this option.</p><p>Finally, there is <a href=\\\\\\"https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/ethics-resources/board-ethical-review-cases/professional-competence-current\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\">BER Case 02-5</a> where a third Engineer A, a structural engineer with experience in the design of structures in the region in which the current project is located, designed a structural system that Engineer A believed was sound and met applicable codes. However, new and improved design methods had recently been suggested in an article published in a technical journal, addressing new information regarding severe weather design in that region. Engineer A had not read that technical journal article. Within a year following construction, the building was damaged by severe weather conditions. It was determined that had the methods suggested in the technical articles been utilized in design, the damage would not have occurred. The BER concluded that it was not unethical for Engineer A to fail to follow methods suggested in a recent technical journal article that Engineer A had not reviewed. The BER indicated that they believed that the definition of what is “current practice” must be discerning and reasonable. The key finding from <span class=\\\\\\"case-reference\\\\\\">Case 02-5</span> was that engineers cannot be expected (obligated) to incorporate each and every new, innovative technique until such techniques are incorporated into generally accepted practice and become standards that should be followed. Engineer T (in the current case) and Engineer A (<span class=\\\\\\"case-reference\\\\\\">Case 02-5</span>) both followed accepted standard design practice. But these same engineers also had the opportunity (not obligation) to take the public welfare more firmly into account, to go above and beyond what was legally and ethically required. While they cannot be ethically faulted for not “going the extra mile” for the sake of the public health, safety, and welfare, the project outcomes likely would have been better if these engineers had done so. In hindsight, knowing the outcomes, the BER believes all parties would have wanted to at least consider the opportunity.</p><p>Collectively, the prior BER Cases reveal several principles to guide the engineer relative to the ethics of the situation. First, the engineer must hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public. Second, engineers must be competent in their areas of service. Third, engineers must be honest, and issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner. Fourth, the engineer must acknowledge their errors and not distort or alter the facts. These ethical obligations are required, and non-negotiable. So it is within this context that the engineer must determine how best to satisfy their obligations. The facts of the present case do not raise concerns about Engineer T’s competence in performing structural engineering design work. Further, Engineer T’s structural modification approach appears to have been straightforward, professionally designed, and properly presented in the construction documents. Not only this, but the design specifically mentions that the new structural connections were located in such a way that access was limited. These points demonstrate proper awareness and consideration of public safety, health, and welfare. When the design was completed, the facts imply Engineer T relied on the contractor to provide for worker safety during construction, and formally transferred this risk and responsibility via standard contractual language. Further, the facts indicate the contractor accepted the construction risk and responsibility without any question. On this basis, the facts do not suggest Engineer T made a design error. As with Engineer A in <span class=\\\\\\"case-reference\\\\\\">Case 97-13</span>, the fact that Engineer T (this present case) noticed after the accident that an alternative design approach could have prevented the worker injury does not mean that Engineer T was required to report this as an error.</p><p>But the question remains – similar to <span class=\\\\\\"case-reference\\\\\\">Case 21-2</span> and <span class=\\\\\\"case-reference\\\\\\">Case 02-5</span> – whether Engineer T did all that could have been done for worker safety? After all, the solution approach Engineer T followed for this project did include an unusual and challenging construction aspect.

On the legal/contractual side, many professional engineers familiar with construction contracts believe contract language sufficiently settles the matter. They point to standard construction contract provisions such as, “Contractor shall be solely responsible for the means, methods, techniques, sequences, and procedures of construction” (Engineers Joint Contract Documents Committee [EJCDC], C-700, Standard General Conditions of the Construction Contract, Article 7, Paragraph 7.01A). The construction contracts also include provisions identifying the Contractor’s sole responsibility for initiating, maintaining, and supervising all safety programs and precautions (Article 7, Paragraph 7.13A), for obtaining additional services as needed to carry out Contractor’s safety responsibilities (Article 7, Paragraph 7.01B), and for taking necessary precautions for safety and providing necessary protection to prevent damage, injury, or loss to all persons on the site who may be affected by the work (Article 7, Paragraph 7.13C). Through these legal/contractual mechanisms, risk and responsibility for worker safety during construction are formally transferred to the contractor, the contractor being the party best positioned to provide for project safety.  By this view, and with reference to the present case, the contractor is solely responsible for project safety, so Engineer T did not make any design error so long as the design met the professional standard of care (which the facts suggest it did).\\nBut engineers must also consider the ethical perspective, and that is the primary area of concern for the Board of Ethical Review. Ethically, the facts of this case reveal a tension between the engineer doing what is professionally required, versus ”going above and beyond” in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare. The Board has considered this ethical tension in various ways over the years.\\nBER Case 97-13 introduces Engineer A, a civil engineer, who serves as a subconsultant to perform bridge inspection services on a major bridge overhaul project. Engineer A’s scope of work is solely to identify any pavement damage on the bridge and report the damage to its client, VWX Architects. While conducting the bridge inspection, and although not part of the scope of services for which he was retained, Engineer A notices an apparent pre-existing defective condition in a retaining wall which failed to restrain a vehicle, leading to a fatal accident involving Police Officer B. Engineer A surmises that the defective condition may have been a contributing factor in the wall failure and notes this in the engineering notes. Engineer A verbally reports this information to the client, which then verbally reports the information to the public agency. In finding it was ethical for Engineer A to retain the information in the engineering notes, but not include it in the final written report, the Board noted that Engineer A did the appropriate thing in coming forward to the client with the information and also by documenting the information for possible future reference as appropriate. But under the circumstances “it would have been improper for Engineer A to include reference to the information in his final report, particularly since it would have been based upon mere speculation and not careful testing or evaluation by a competent individual or firm.” In fact, the Board opined that had Engineer A formally “reported” the matter publicly, it would have been “an overreaction and could easily have risked jeopardizing the professional reputations of [Engineer A’s] client and the public agency.” The key finding from Case 97-13 is that the public welfare was best served by Engineer A exercising restraint in reporting. This parallels the current case, where Engineer A identified a safety risk in the design details, but per customary professional practice relied on the contractor (who had specific construction safety expertise) to address the issue.\\nA second example is BER Case 21-2 , where a second Engineer A serves as a consulting engineer representing Client B, a developer who is proposing to develop a healthcare facility that requires a significant upgrade to the property’s access road that crosses a tidal saltmarsh. Engineer A’s scope includes design and local permitting of the roadway, including an upgrade of the tidal crossing from a small culvert to a small bridge, increasing its hydraulic capacity. The local development regulations and national design codes and standards have not yet been updated to reflect changing conditions and weather patterns, including effects of sea level rise and changes in precipitation intensities and recurrence intervals effected by on-going climate change. It is Engineer A’s judgment, based on hydraulic evaluation procedures presented at a recent transportation agency conference, that the proposed project may result in some upstream homes becoming uninhabitable a decade or more earlier than would otherwise be the case. Engineer A proposes a complex and costly hydrologic and hydraulic analysis by a specialized subconsultant to predict the extent to which sea level rise and the increased hydraulic capacity of the tidal crossing will result in flood damage to a neighborhood of twenty upstream homes during future high tides and storm surges, anticipating this to be a difficult question to answer in the project’s public hearings. Client B directs Engineer A to proceed without the costly analysis unless and until such an analysis is requested by the applicable regulatory authorities. In this case, the BER found that “if Engineer A is reasonably certain that the project will result in adverse impacts to public health, safety, and welfare, and if the Client B denies the requisite evaluation, Engineer A should include the concern regarding potential adverse public health, safety, and welfare impacts in an engineering report for consideration by regulatory agencies and the public.” Thus, the key finding from Case 21-2 is that the public welfare was best served by Engineer A reporting the public health, safety, and welfare concerns, even if the client did not wish for this to be done. This differs from the current case, not because public health, safety, and welfare is somehow less important now than in Case 21-2 , but because a project delivery process exists in this case by which it was accepted professional practice for Engineer A to complete the structural design, and rely on the contractor to handle safety aspects of construction. The Engineer A from Case 21-2 did not have this option.\\nFinally, there is BER Case 02-5 where a third Engineer A, a structural engineer with experience in the design of structures in the region in which the current project is located, designed a structural system that Engineer A believed was sound and met applicable codes. However, new and improved design methods had recently been suggested in an article published in a technical journal, addressing new information regarding severe weather design in that region. Engineer A had not read that technical journal article. Within a year following construction, the building was damaged by severe weather conditions. It was determined that had the methods suggested in the technical articles been utilized in design, the damage would not have occurred. The BER concluded that it was not unethical for Engineer A to fail to follow methods suggested in a recent technical journal article that Engineer A had not reviewed. The BER indicated that they believed that the definition of what is “current practice” must be discerning and reasonable. The key finding from Case 02-5 was that engineers cannot be expected (obligated) to incorporate each and every new, innovative technique until such techniques are incorporated into generally accepted practice and become standards that should be followed. Engineer T (in the current case) and Engineer A ( Case 02-5 ) both followed accepted standard design practice. But these same engineers also had the opportunity (not obligation) to take the public welfare more firmly into account, to go above and beyond what was legally and ethically required. While they cannot be ethically faulted for not “going the extra mile” for the sake of the public health, safety, and welfare, the project outcomes likely would have been better if these engineers had done so. In hindsight, knowing the outcomes, the BER believes all parties would have wanted to at least consider the opportunity.\\nCollectively, the prior BER Cases reveal several principles to guide the engineer relative to the ethics of the situation. First, the engineer must hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public. Second, engineers must be competent in their areas of service. Third, engineers must be honest, and issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner. Fourth, the engineer must acknowledge their errors and not distort or alter the facts. These ethical obligations are required, and non-negotiable. So it is within this context that the engineer must determine how best to satisfy their obligations. The facts of the present case do not raise concerns about Engineer T’s competence in performing structural engineering design work. Further, Engineer T’s structural modification approach appears to have been straightforward, professionally designed, and properly presented in the construction documents. Not only this, but the design specifically mentions that the new structural connections were located in such a way that access was limited. These points demonstrate proper awareness and consideration of public safety, health, and welfare. When the design was completed, the facts imply Engineer T relied on the contractor to provide for worker safety during construction, and formally transferred this risk and responsibility via standard contractual language. Further, the facts indicate the contractor accepted the construction risk and responsibility without any question. On this basis, the facts do not suggest Engineer T made a design error. As with Engineer A in Case 97-13 , the fact that Engineer T (this present case) noticed after the accident that an alternative design approach could have prevented the worker injury does not mean that Engineer T was required to report this as an error.\\nBut the question remains – similar to Case 21-2 and Case 02-5 – whether Engineer T did all that could have been done for worker safety? After all, the solution approach Engineer T followed for this project did include an unusual and challenging construction aspect. Was it enough simply to call attention to this and shift safety responsibility to the contractor? Case 21-2 suggests it would have been ethically appropriate (an opportunity, not an obligation) for Engineer T to identify not just the straightforward design alternative, but also the more involved structural modification concept, to identify and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of both options, and to place these matters before the client and other members of the design team, possibly including the contractor, early in the process. Another option would have been for Engineer T to request a constructability review, or an independent construction safety review, or to inquire whether the contractor’s construction safety plan had flagged the heightened safety risk. If so, perhaps the issue would have been raised and alternatives might have been addressed. But Engineer T did not actively seek this input, and perhaps that is why Engineer T “felt some personal responsibility for the accident.”\\nBut was this an “error?” Did Engineer T and/or Engineer B deviate from ethical engineering practice under the facts? The BER affirms the “ethical high road” of considering more than one design approach, and certainly the BER would agree with seeking critical input from construction safety professionals. But as in Case 02-5 , the BER does not view Engineer T’s design as unethical. While the construction accident and worker injury are tragic outcomes, because Engineer T’s design approach represented professional practice consistent with the standard of care, the BER sees this more as a missed opportunity than an ethical lapse and concludes that no “error” was made in design.\\nWas it ethical for Engineer T not to acknowledge an error after the accident occurred? The facts of this case and especially the discussion between Engineer T and Engineer B, as well as the legal/contractual perspective and ethical considerations outlined above, provide a rationale as to why Engineer T’s design was not an “error.” Because there was no error, Engineer T was not ethically obligated to acknowledge an error after the accident occurred. However, the BER believes this project was a missed opportunity for Engineer T to more fully and carefully hold paramount the public safety, health, and welfare.\\nThe BER believes Engineer T should state that while no error was made, based on hindsight, other ways to approach the project existed which may have prevented the accident and worker injury. The view is consistent with ethics provisions that require engineers to be objective and truthful in professional reports, statements, or testimony; that engineers include all relevant and pertinent information, that they not distort or alter the facts, and avoid the use of statements containing a material misrepresentation of fact or omitting a material fact; and that they accept personal responsibility for their professional activities.

In establishing the project scope for the structural modifications, Engineer T selected a straightforward approach that required making structural connections immediately beneath floor level on an upper floor, in a tightly constrained space. Engineer T proceeded with the project per these parameters and did not explore alternative design approaches. Rather, Engineer T completed the design within the identified constraints and issued construction documents for the modifications.The new structural connections were located in such a way that access was limited, and the drawings clearly noted the constrained access. This design detail required the construction workers to make the connections in a contorted fashion. During construction, an accident occurred with a serious and permanent injury to a construction worker. Following the accident, Engineer T revisited the site and realized that had alternative design concepts been explored early on, the new structural modifications could have been proposed in a fundamentally different, more complex, but functionally equivalent way. The alternative approach would have been more costly and taken more time, but it would have allowed the construction workers to make all connections while standing on the floor such that injury would have been far less likely. Engineer T felt some personal responsibility for the accident.Engineer T met with XYZ’s Chief Structural Engineer, Engineer B, explained the situation, and expressed a belief that a design error – i.e., not exploring alternative, safer design concepts – had been made and the NSPE Code of Ethics required that the error be acknowledged. Engineer B responded that Engineer T and XYZ Consulting Engineers had responded professionally to the design project, they had recommended a straightforward structural modification approach, and they were not expected or asked to consider alternative concepts. Further, Engineer T had specifically identified the constrained area of the new connections in the design documents, but because T was not trained in construction safety either by education (since civil engineering education typically does not include construction safety) or by specific experience (working for a construction contractor), Engineer T could not have reasonably known or assessed the level of worker safety risk posed by the connection location. The contractor had not raised questions regarding the construction safety risk or safer construction alternatives. Having thus thoughtfully considered the matter, both Engineer T and Engineer B decided that the situation did not merit acknowledgement of “an error.”Months later, after a construction claim had been submitted and a lawsuit had been filed, Engineer T met with attorneys representing XYZ and XYZ’s insurance company to prepare for a deposition of Engineer T.

They point to standard construction contract provisions such as, “Contractor shall be solely responsible for the means, methods, techniques, sequences, and procedures of construction” (Engineers Joint Contract Documents Committee [EJCDC], C-700, Standard General Conditions of the Construction Contract, Article 7, Paragraph 7.01A). The construction contracts also include provisions identifying the Contractor’s sole responsibility for initiating, maintaining, and supervising all safety programs and precautions (Article 7, Paragraph 7.13A), for obtaining additional services as needed to carry out Contractor’s safety responsibilities (Article 7, Paragraph 7.01B), and for taking necessary precautions for safety and providing necessary protection to prevent damage, injury, or loss to all persons on the site who may be affected by the work (Article 7, Paragraph 7.13C). Through these legal/contractual mechanisms, risk and responsibility for worker safety during construction are formally transferred to the contractor, the contractor being the party best positioned to provide for project safety.  By this view, and with reference to the present case, the contractor is solely responsible for project safety, so Engineer T did not make any design error so long as the design met the professional standard of care (which the facts suggest it did).\\nBut engineers must also consider the ethical perspective, and that is the primary area of concern for the Board of Ethical Review. Ethically, the facts of this case reveal a tension between the engineer doing what is professionally required, versus ”going above and beyond” in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare. The Board has considered this ethical tension in various ways over the years.\\nBER Case 97-13 introduces Engineer A, a civil engineer, who serves as a subconsultant to perform bridge inspection services on a major bridge overhaul project. Engineer A’s scope of work is solely to identify any pavement damage on the bridge and report the damage to its client, VWX Architects. While conducting the bridge inspection, and although not part of the scope of services for which he was retained, Engineer A notices an apparent pre-existing defective condition in a retaining wall which failed to restrain a vehicle, leading to a fatal accident involving Police Officer B. Engineer A surmises that the defective condition may have been a contributing factor in the wall failure and notes this in the engineering notes. Engineer A verbally reports this information to the client, which then verbally reports the information to the public agency. In finding it was ethical for Engineer A to retain the information in the engineering notes, but not include it in the final written report, the Board noted that Engineer A did the appropriate thing in coming forward to the client with the information and also by documenting the information for possible future reference as appropriate. But under the circumstances “it would have been improper for Engineer A to include reference to the information in his final report, particularly since it would have been based upon mere speculation and not careful testing or evaluation by a competent individual or firm.” In fact, the Board opined that had Engineer A formally “reported” the matter publicly, it would have been “an overreaction and could easily have risked jeopardizing the professional reputations of [Engineer A’s] client and the public agency.” The key finding from Case 97-13 is that the public welfare was best served by Engineer A exercising restraint in reporting. This parallels the current case, where Engineer A identified a safety risk in the design details, but per customary professional practice relied on the contractor (who had specific construction safety expertise) to address the issue.\\nA second example is BER Case 21-2 , where a second Engineer A serves as a consulting engineer representing Client B, a developer who is proposing to develop a healthcare facility that requires a significant upgrade to the property’s access road that crosses a tidal saltmarsh. Engineer A’s scope includes design and local permitting of the roadway, including an upgrade of the tidal crossing from a small culvert to a small bridge, increasing its hydraulic capacity. The local development regulations and national design codes and standards have not yet been updated to reflect changing conditions and weather patterns, including effects of sea level rise and changes in precipitation intensities and recurrence intervals effected by on-going climate change. It is Engineer A’s judgment, based on hydraulic evaluation procedures presented at a recent transportation agency conference, that the proposed project may result in some upstream homes becoming uninhabitable a decade or more earlier than would otherwise be the case. Engineer A proposes a complex and costly hydrologic and hydraulic analysis by a specialized subconsultant to predict the extent to which sea level rise and the increased hydraulic capacity of the tidal crossing will result in flood damage to a neighborhood of twenty upstream homes during future high tides and storm surges, anticipating this to be a difficult question to answer in the project’s public hearings. Client B directs Engineer A to proceed without the costly analysis unless and until such an analysis is requested by the applicable regulatory authorities. In this case, the BER found that “if Engineer A is reasonably certain that the project will result in adverse impacts to public health, safety, and welfare, and if the Client B denies the requisite evaluation, Engineer A should include the concern regarding potential adverse public health, safety, and welfare impacts in an engineering report for consideration by regulatory agencies and the public.” Thus, the key finding from Case 21-2 is that the public welfare was best served by Engineer A reporting the public health, safety, and welfare concerns, even if the client did not wish for this to be done. This differs from the current case, not because public health, safety, and welfare is somehow less important now than in Case 21-2 , but because a project delivery process exists in this case by which it was accepted professional practice for Engineer A to complete the structural design, and rely on the contractor to handle safety aspects of construction. The Engineer A from Case 21-2 did not have this option.\\nFinally, there is BER Case 02-5 where a third Engineer A, a structural engineer with experience in the design of structures in the region in which the current project is located, designed a structural system that Engineer A believed was sound and met applicable codes. However, new and improved design methods had recently been suggested in an article published in a technical journal, addressing new information regarding severe weather design in that region. Engineer A had not read that technical journal article. Within a year following construction, the building was damaged by severe weather conditions. It was determined that had the methods suggested in the technical articles been utilized in design, the damage would not have occurred. The BER concluded that it was not unethical for Engineer A to fail to follow methods suggested in a recent technical journal article that Engineer A had not reviewed. The BER indicated that they believed that the definition of what is “current practice” must be discerning and reasonable. The key finding from Case 02-5 was that engineers cannot be expected (obligated) to incorporate each and every new, innovative technique until such techniques are incorporated into generally accepted practice and become standards that should be followed. Engineer T (in the current case) and Engineer A ( Case 02-5 ) both followed accepted standard design practice. But these same engineers also had the opportunity (not obligation) to take the public welfare more firmly into account, to go above and beyond what was legally and ethically required. While they cannot be ethically faulted for not “going the extra mile” for the sake of the public health, safety, and welfare, the project outcomes likely would have been better if these engineers had done so. In hindsight, knowing the outcomes, the BER believes all parties would have wanted to at least consider the opportunity.\\nCollectively, the prior BER Cases reveal several principles to guide the engineer relative to the ethics of the situation. First, the engineer must hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public. Second, engineers must be competent in their areas of service. Third, engineers must be honest, and issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner. Fourth, the engineer must acknowledge their errors and not distort or alter the facts. These ethical obligations are required, and non-negotiable. So it is within this context that the engineer must determine how best to satisfy their obligations. The facts of the present case do not raise concerns about Engineer T’s competence in performing structural engineering design work. Further, Engineer T’s structural modification approach appears to have been straightforward, professionally designed, and properly presented in the construction documents. Not only this, but the design specifically mentions that the new structural connections were located in such a way that access was limited. These points demonstrate proper awareness and consideration of public safety, health, and welfare. When the design was completed, the facts imply Engineer T relied on the contractor to provide for worker safety during construction, and formally transferred this risk and responsibility via standard contractual language. Further, the facts indicate the contractor accepted the construction risk and responsibility without any question. On this basis, the facts do not suggest Engineer T made a design error. As with Engineer A in Case 97-13 , the fact that Engineer T (this present case) noticed after the accident that an alternative design approach could have prevented the worker injury does not mean that Engineer T was required to report this as an error.\\nBut the question remains – similar to Case 21-2 and Case 02-5 – whether Engineer T did all that could have been done for worker safety? After all, the solution approach Engineer T followed for this project did include an unusual and challenging construction aspect. Was it enough simply to call attention to this and shift safety responsibility to the contractor? Case 21-2 suggests it would have been ethically appropriate (an opportunity, not an obligation) for Engineer T to identify not just the straightforward design alternative, but also the more involved structural modification concept, to identify and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of both options, and to place these matters before the client and other members of the design team, possibly including the contractor, early in the process. Another option would have been for Engineer T to request a constructability review, or an independent construction safety review, or to inquire whether the contractor’s construction safety plan had flagged the heightened safety risk. If so, perhaps the issue would have been raised and alternatives might have been addressed. But Engineer T did not actively seek this input, and perhaps that is why Engineer T “felt some personal responsibility for the accident.”\\nBut was this an “error?” Did Engineer T and/or Engineer B deviate from ethical engineering practice under the facts? The BER affirms the “ethical high road” of considering more than one design approach, and certainly the BER would agree with seeking critical input from construction safety professionals. But as in Case 02-5 , the BER does not view Engineer T’s design as unethical. While the construction accident and worker injury are tragic outcomes, because Engineer T’s design approach represented professional practice consistent with the standard of care, the BER sees this more as a missed opportunity than an ethical lapse and concludes that no “error” was made in design.\\nWas it ethical for Engineer T not to acknowledge an error after the accident occurred? The facts of this case and especially the discussion between Engineer T and Engineer B, as well as the legal/contractual perspective and ethical considerations outlined above, provide a rationale as to why Engineer T’s design was not an “error.” Because there was no error, Engineer T was not ethically obligated to acknowledge an error after the accident occurred. However, the BER believes this project was a missed opportunity for Engineer T to more fully and carefully hold paramount the public safety, health, and welfare.\\nThe BER believes Engineer T should state that while no error was made, based on hindsight, other ways to approach the project existed which may have prevented the accident and worker injury. The view is consistent with ethics provisions that require engineers to be objective and truthful in professional reports, statements, or testimony; that engineers include all relevant and pertinent information, that they not distort or alter the facts, and avoid the use of statements containing a material misrepresentation of fact or omitting a material fact; and that they accept personal responsibility for their professional activities. Such conversation will not only allow Engineer T’s firm and others to benefit from lessons learned through this very difficult experience but will also promote continued professional development relative to projects of this type.\\nWas it ethical for Engineer T not to acknowledge an error during the deposition? Again, using the same analysis presented above, the BER concludes that Engineer T’s design was not an “error.” Because there was no error, Engineer T was not ethically obligated to acknowledge an error during the deposition. Engineer T should respond clearly and honestly when questioned about the project, including T’s views on alternative design approaches vis-à-vis the public safety, health, and welfare, but should not characterize the work as a design error.", "content_type": "text"}, "http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/question_1": {"type": "question_item", "content": "Was it ethical for Engineer T and Engineer B to conclude an error had not been made in design?", "content_type": "text"}, "http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/question_2": {"type": "question_item", "content": "Was it ethical for Engineer T not to acknowledge an error after the accident occurred?", "content_type": "text"}, "http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/question_3": {"type": "question_item", "content": "Was it ethical for Engineer T not to acknowledge an error during the deposition?", "content_type": "text"}, "http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4/references": {"type": "references", "content": "I.1.

1	Engineering	The Engineering Ethics World represents a domain where engineers navigate complex ethical dilemmas requiring the application of abstract principles to concrete situations. In this world, professionals must balance their paramount duty to protect public safety against other obligations such as client confidentiality, employer loyalty, and professional integrity. Decision-making involves analyzing specific facts, identifying relevant ethical codes, resolving conflicts between competing principles through operationalization, and drawing analogies to precedent cases. The world encompasses scenarios involving safety assessments, environmental impacts, product integrity, confidential information, and professional conduct, all within organizational contexts that include established hierarchies, procedures, and economic pressures that influence ethical judgments.	engineering-ethics	1	2025-04-03 17:56:59.465401	2025-04-26 20:37:31.253168	[4, 5, 6, 7]	[]	{}
