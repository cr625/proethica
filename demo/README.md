# Demo Snapshots

This folder contains publication-ready mockups for Case 24-02.

- `case24_02_compact.html` — compact, width-optimized panel for embedding in the main paper body (fits wider-than-tall figure slots).
- `case24_02_appendix.html` — larger version suitable for the appendix.

How to use:
- Open the HTML file in a browser and capture a screenshot or print to PDF.
- The compact version uses an aspect ratio hint (16:9) so width exceeds height.
- Content mirrors the live route at `/cases/24-02/hero/compact` but is self-contained (no external CSS).

Scope:
- Includes roles-first overview, timeline decisions + recommendations, precedent case themes, guideline references, and planned ontology links.
- Avoids marketing headers and focuses on decision support for the human reader.
