Engineering Code of Ethics - Guidelines for Professional Conduct

The following principles form the cornerstone of ethical engineering practice:

1. Hold Paramount the Safety, Health, and Welfare of the Public
Engineers shall recognize that the lives, safety, health, and welfare of the general public are dependent upon engineering decisions, judgment, and practices. Engineering designs, services, and products must prioritize public safety above all other considerations.

2. Perform Services Only in Areas of Competence
Engineers shall perform services only in areas of their competence based on education, training, and experience. They must not undertake technical assignments for which they are not qualified.

3. Issue Public Statements Only in an Objective and Truthful Manner
Engineers shall be objective and truthful in professional reports, statements, or testimony. They shall include all relevant and pertinent information in such reports, statements, or testimony.

4. Act for Each Employer or Client as Faithful Agents or Trustees
Engineers shall act with fairness and justice to all parties when serving as expert witnesses, performing contract reviews, or providing opinions.

5. Avoid Deceptive Acts
Engineers shall not falsify or permit misrepresentation of their academic or professional qualifications. They shall not misrepresent or exaggerate their responsibility in or for the subject matter of prior assignments.

6. Conduct Engineering Activities in an Honorable and Ethical Manner
Engineers shall act in accordance with the highest principles of ethical conduct. They shall disclose any potential conflicts of interest that could influence their judgment or the quality of their services.

7. Maintain Confidentiality
Engineers shall not disclose, without proper authorization, confidential information concerning the proprietary business affairs or technical processes of any present or former client or employer.

8. Engage in Professional Development
Engineers shall continue their professional development throughout their careers and shall provide opportunities for the professional development of those engineers under their supervision.

9. Consider Environmental Impact
Engineers shall consider environmental factors and sustainability in their decision-making and strive to minimize adverse environmental effects of their operations.

10. Report Ethical Violations
Engineers who have knowledge of possible violations of ethical standards shall present such information to the proper authority for action. Engineers shall not retaliate against whistleblowers.

Adherence to these guidelines requires a commitment to ethical values that transcend technical compliance, embracing a broader sense of responsibility to society, clients, the profession, and fellow engineers.
