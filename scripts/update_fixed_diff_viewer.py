## {today} - Ontology Version Diff Viewer Fixes

### Issues Fixed

1. **Backend API Issues**
   - Fixed syntax errors in docstring that prevented the server from starting
   - Enhanced error handling for same-version comparisons
   - Fixed issues with missing request imports
   - Added proper 404 handling for missing versions
   - Improved error response formatting

2. **Frontend JavaScript Issues**
   - Fixed error handling in HTTP fetch calls
   - Added response status checking and improved error messages
   - Fixed handling for same-version comparisons
   - Added footer close button event handler
   - Added client-side handling to avoid unnecessary API calls

### Implementation Details
- Created `scripts/fix_diff_api.py` to fix backend API issues
- Created `scripts/update_diff_viewer_fix.py` to fix frontend error handling
- Created `scripts/update_footer_close_handler.py` to fix missing button handler
- Created `scripts/fix_docstring_syntax.py` to fix the syntax error in docstring
- Created `scripts/verify_diff_function.py` for testing the API directly
- Made all fixes with proper backups and documentation

### Key Improvements
- Server now starts properly without syntax errors
- Comparing same versions no longer causes a 500 error
- Unified and split diff views work correctly
- Improved error messages with troubleshooting suggestions
- Enhanced UI with metadata display for versions

### Verification Steps
1. Server starts without any syntax errors
2. Opening the diff modal and comparing versions works
3. Same-version comparisons show a friendly message
4. Error handling provides useful troubleshooting information
5. All buttons (including footer close) work correctly
