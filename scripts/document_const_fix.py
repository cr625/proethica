## {today} - Fixed JavaScript Constant Variable Reassignment

### Issue Fixed

Fixed JavaScript errors that occurred when comparing versions:

```
Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
    at HTMLSelectElement.<anonymous> (diff.js:91:21)
    at HTMLInputElement.<anonymous> (diff.js:44:21)
```

### Root Cause Analysis

The bug was in the version validation code in diff.js, where variables declared with `const` were later being modified:

```javascript
// Variable declared as constant
const fromVersion = document.getElementById('diffFromVersion').value;

// ...later in the code...
// Attempting to modify a constant (causes error)
fromVersion = fromVersion.toString().trim();
```

In JavaScript, variables declared with `const` cannot be reassigned after initialization, which was causing the runtime errors.

### Solution

Changed variable declarations from `const` to `let` for variables that need to be modified:

```javascript
// Changed to let to allow reassignment
let fromVersion = document.getElementById('diffFromVersion').value;

// ...later in the code...
// Now works correctly
fromVersion = fromVersion.toString().trim();
```

This fix was applied to all instances where version variables are declared but later modified:
1. In the format toggle event handler
2. In the from-version dropdown change handler
3. In the to-version dropdown change handler
4. In the apply button click handler

### Implementation Details

The fix was implemented with a script that:
1. Identified all instances of version variables declared with `const` but later modified
2. Replaced those declarations with `let` instead
3. Kept all other code logic intact

### Verification

The fix was verified by:
1. Confirming the absence of JavaScript errors in the console
2. Testing version selection in the diff modal
3. Verifying proper version comparison functionality

This fix resolves the last JavaScript runtime error in the diff viewer, allowing users to properly select and compare different versions of ontologies.
