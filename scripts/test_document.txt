            4. End-of-life care decisions
            
            Healthcare professionals often face ethical dilemmas when patient autonomy conflicts with 
            beneficence or non-maleficence. For example, a patient may refuse life-saving treatment 
            based on religious beliefs, creating a conflict between respecting autonomy and the 
            healthcare provider's duty to prevent harm.
            
            Resource allocation presents another ethical challenge, especially in settings with limited 
            resources. How should scarce medical resources be distributed? Should priority be given based 
            on severity of condition, likelihood of recovery, age, or other factors?
            
            End-of-life care decisions involve complex ethical considerations around quality of life, 
            dignity in dying, and the appropriate use of life-sustaining treatments. These decisions 
            often involve multiple stakeholders including patients, families, and healthcare providers.
