## {today} - Fixed JavaScript Data Undefined Error in Diff Viewer

### Issue Fixed

Fixed the final bug in the diff viewer where accessing properties of undefined objects was causing errors:

```
Error loading diff: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'number')
```

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the data handling section of `loadDiff` function in `diff.js`, where properties were being accessed without checking if the parent objects existed:

```javascript
document.getElementById('diffFromInfo').innerText =
    `Version ${{data.from_version.number}} - ${{formatDate(data.from_version.created_at)}}`;
```

This would fail if `data` or `data.from_version` was undefined, which could happen if:
1. The server returned an unexpected response format
2. The API endpoint had an error but returned a 200 status
3. The data structure changed

### Solution

1. Added null/undefined checks before accessing nested properties:

```javascript
document.getElementById('diffFromInfo').innerText = 
    data && data.from_version ? 
    `Version ${{data.from_version.number || 'N/A'}} - ${{formatDate(data.from_version.created_at || null)}}` : 
    'Version information unavailable';
```

2. Added comprehensive data validation before processing:

```javascript
// Validate data structure
if (!data || !data.diff) {{
    diffContent.innerHTML = `
        <div class="alert alert-danger">
            <h5>Invalid Response Format</h5>
            <p>The server response did not contain the expected data format.</p>
            <pre>${{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}}</pre>
        </div>
    `;
    return;
}}
```

3. Added safe property access for all other data object uses:
   - Updated commit message handling
   - Added fallback values
   - Used optional chaining pattern

### Implementation Details

The fix uses defensive programming principles:
1. Never assume an object exists before accessing its properties
2. Always provide fallback values
3. Validate data early and show clear error messages
4. Show useful debugging information when possible

### Verification

The diff viewer now handles all edge cases gracefully:
1. Properly compares different versions
2. Shows useful error messages if data is missing
3. Doesn't throw uncaught exceptions
4. Provides debugging information for troubleshooting

This fix completes the series of improvements to the diff viewer, making it fully functional and robust.
