### Actions Taken

1. **Consolidated Requirements Files**
   - Merged multiple requirements files into a single requirements.txt
   - Removed redundant requirements-cleaned.txt and requirements-final.txt
   - Created a well-organized, categorized requirements file

2. **Updated Anthropic SDK Dependency**
   - Updated anthropic library specification to >=0.50.0
   - Ensured compatibility with the newer Anthropic API format
   - Maintained proper dependency organization with clear categories

3. **Enhanced Documentation**
   - Added clear category headers for different types of dependencies
   - Included helpful comments explaining each dependency's purpose
   - Organized dependencies in logical functional groups

### Benefits

- **Simplified Dependency Management**: Single source of truth for all project dependencies
- **Clearer Organization**: Dependencies categorized by function and importance
- **Up-to-date Requirements**: Latest Anthropic SDK version properly specified
- **Better Documentation**: Each dependency section clearly labeled and commented

### Implementation

The cleanup was implemented by:
1. Analyzing existing requirements files to identify all necessary dependencies
2. Checking installed package versions to ensure accuracy (especially anthropic)
3. Creating a comprehensive, well-structured requirements.txt
4. Committing the changes to version control
