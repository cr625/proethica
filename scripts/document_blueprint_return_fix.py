## {today} - Fixed Missing Blueprint Return in API Routes

### Issue Fixed

Fixed a critical error in the ontology editor API routes where the `create_api_routes` function was not returning the blueprint object, causing:

```python
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'subdomain'
```

### Root Cause

The `create_api_routes` function in `ontology_editor/api/routes.py` was creating and configuring a Flask blueprint object (`api_bp`), but was missing the crucial `return api_bp` statement at the end of the function. 

When the main application tried to register the blueprint with `app.register_blueprint(ontology_editor_bp)`, it was actually receiving `None` instead of a valid Flask blueprint object, resulting in the attribute error.

### Solution Implementation

1. Added a proper `return api_bp` statement at the end of the `create_api_routes` function
2. Created the fix with a dedicated script that:
   - Identified the function boundary
   - Preserved existing code and indentation
   - Inserted the return statement with appropriate spacing
   - Made a backup of the original file before modification

### Verification

- Confirmed the server now starts without the blueprint registration error
- Verified the proper blueprint creation and return process
- Ran test script to ensure server startup success

### Key Lesson

This fix reinforces the importance of properly returning objects from factory functions when using a modular Flask application architecture. All blueprint factory functions must explicitly return the created blueprint object for successful registration with the main application.
