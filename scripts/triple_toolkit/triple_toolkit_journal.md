# Triple Toolkit Development Journal

## 2025-05-22: Initial Implementation

### Components Created

- **Common Utilities**
  - `db_utils.py`: Database connection helpers and Flask app context management
  - `formatting.py`: Text formatting utilities for consistent output
  - `pagination.py`: Interactive pagination for working with large result sets

- **Command-Line Tools**
  - `list_worlds.py`: List and inspect worlds in the database
  - `list_guidelines.py`: View guidelines in worlds
  - `list_guideline_concepts.py`: Explore concepts linked to guidelines
  - `find_orphaned_triples.py`: Identify triples without proper associations

- **Runner Scripts**
  - Added Bash wrapper scripts for each tool to handle environment setup
  - Implemented DATABASE_URL environment variable support
  - Added fallback to default database URL

### Key Features

- Interactive navigation through large datasets
- Consistent formatting across all tools
- Multiple output formats (simple, detailed, triples)
- Database connection error handling
- Command-line argument parsing with help documentation

### Technical Challenges

- **Flask App Context**: Solved issues with creating a proper Flask app context for ORM operations outside the web application
- **Database Configuration**: Implemented environment variable handling to ensure database connection works in all environments
- **Display Formatting**: Created utilities for consistent terminal output with proper wrapping and pagination

### Next Steps

- **Triple Analysis Tools**: Add utilities for analyzing triple patterns and relationships
- **Section Association**: Develop tools for managing associations between triples and document sections
- **Triple Cleanup**: Create utilities for fixing orphaned or invalid triples
- **Visualization**: Consider adding ASCII or terminal-based visualization of triple relationships
- **Export/Import**: Add tools for exporting and importing triples between environments
