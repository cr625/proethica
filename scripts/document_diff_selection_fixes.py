## {today} - Fixed Version Selection in Ontology Diff Viewer

### Issue Fixed

Fixed the issue where the diff viewer would always compare version 11 to version 11, regardless of which versions were selected in the dropdown menus. Users were seeing:

```
Invalid Response Format
The server response did not contain the expected data format.
{{}}
```

### Root Cause Analysis

Multiple issues were contributing to the version selection problem:

1. **Missing Ontology ID**: The diff viewer didn't have access to the current ontology ID when making API requests
2. **Version Selection Issue**: Selected versions in dropdowns weren't being properly applied to API calls
3. **Parameter Validation**: Version numbers weren't being properly validated before use

### Comprehensive Solution

1. **Added Ontology ID Access**:
   - Added a hidden input field to store the current ontology ID: `<input type="hidden" id="currentOntologyId" value="{{ ontology_id }}">`
   - Modified JavaScript to access this value when building API URLs

2. **Fixed Version Selection Logic**:
   - Enhanced dropdown selection to use proper indexing instead of direct value assignment
   - Implemented proper selection of "to" version based on "from" version
   - Added validation to ensure correct version values are used

3. **Added Debugging Information**:
   - Added console logging of version selections and API parameters
   - Improved error handling to show detailed information about response data

### Implementation Details

This fix required changes to both the HTML template and JavaScript:

1. **HTML Template Updates**:
   - Added currentOntologyId hidden input to the diff modal
   - Ensured proper template variable for ontology_id was available

2. **JavaScript Fixes**:
   - Enhanced version dropdown selection logic
   - Added explicit version validation
   - Improved ontology ID detection with fallbacks
   - Added debugging information

### Verification

The fix was verified by:
1. Confirming version dropdowns work as expected
2. Testing different version selection combinations
3. Checking API requests have correct parameters
4. Verifying diff content loads properly

With these fixes in place, users can now properly compare any two versions of an ontology, making it much easier to track changes over time.
