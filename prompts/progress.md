# Progress Report

## 1. Switching to pgvector for Embeddings

### Overview

We have successfully switched the document embedding system to use pgvector for storing and querying vector embeddings. This change provides better performance and more accurate similarity search compared to the previous fallback approach.

### Changes Made

1. **Updated Document Model**:
   - Changed the `embedding` column in the `DocumentChunk` model to use the `Vector` type from pgvector instead of `Text`
   - Removed the fallback approach where embeddings were stored as JSON strings

2. **Updated Embedding Service**:
   - Modified the `_store_chunks` method to store embeddings directly as vector types
   - Updated the `search_similar_chunks` method to use pgvector's native similarity search functionality
   - Removed the fallback similarity search implementation that used manual cosine distance calculation

3. **Database Migration**:
   - Created a migration script to drop and recreate the document_chunks table with the vector type
   - Added a vector similarity index for faster similarity search

4. **Testing**:
   - Created a simple test script to verify pgvector functionality
   - Confirmed that storing and querying vector embeddings works correctly

### Benefits

- **Improved Performance**: pgvector's native similarity search is much faster than the previous approach, especially as the number of documents grows
- **Better Accuracy**: Using pgvector's optimized vector operations ensures more accurate similarity search results
- **Reduced Complexity**: Removed the fallback code that was needed when pgvector wasn't available
- **Scalability**: The solution can now handle a larger number of documents efficiently

## 2. Document Status Fix

### Overview

We identified and fixed an issue with the document status indicator in the guidelines page. Documents that had content were still showing as "processing" in some cases, even though they were fully processed.

### Changes Made

1. **Document Status Endpoint Enhancement**:
   - Updated the `/documents/status/<id>` endpoint to auto-correct document status when content exists but status is still marked as processing
   - Added a `has_content` flag to the response to help the frontend make better decisions
   - Improved error handling for null progress values
   - Added logging for status corrections

2. **Task Queue Processing Improvement**:
   - Enhanced the background task processing to check if a document already has content before starting processing
   - Ensured consistent status updates across all processing phases
   - Set the processing phase to a consistent value when marking as completed
   - Added proper handling for edge cases where content exists but status is incorrect

3. **Testing**:
   - Tested the fix with both the standard Flask development server and with Gunicorn in production mode
   - Verified that documents with content display properly without showing processing indicators
   - Confirmed that the content is accessible via the Show/Hide button

### Benefits

- **Improved User Experience**: Documents with content are always shown correctly without processing indicators
- **Accurate Status Representation**: The UI properly reflects the actual document state
- **Automatic Error Correction**: Status inconsistencies are automatically corrected
- **Reliable Progress Tracking**: The progress bar updates correctly during actual processing

## 3. Document Status Maintenance Script

### Overview

We created a maintenance script and cron job setup to automatically check for and fix documents that might be stuck in processing state.

### Changes Made

1. **Document Status Fix Script**:
   - Created a Python script (`scripts/fix_document_status.py`) that checks for documents in processing state
   - The script identifies documents that have content but are still marked as processing and fixes their status
   - It also detects documents that have been processing for too long (more than 10 minutes) and marks them as failed
   - Includes dry-run and verbose modes for safe testing and detailed logging

2. **Cron Job Setup**:
   - Created a shell script (`scripts/setup_document_status_cron.sh`) to set up a cron job
   - The cron job runs the fix script every hour
   - Logs are written to a dedicated log file for easy monitoring
   - The setup script handles checking for existing cron jobs to avoid duplicates

### Benefits

- **Automatic Recovery**: The system can now automatically recover from stuck processing states
- **Improved Reliability**: Documents won't remain in an incorrect state indefinitely
- **Better Diagnostics**: Failed processing is properly marked and logged
- **Minimal Maintenance**: The hourly cron job requires no manual intervention

## Next Steps

- Consider adding more sophisticated indexing strategies as the document collection grows
- Explore pgvector's additional similarity metrics (Euclidean distance, inner product) for different use cases
- Optimize chunk size and overlap parameters for better search results
- Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed documents
- Add a frontend check to detect stalled processing (e.g., if a document has been in "processing" state for more than 5 minutes)
- Add more detailed logging for document processing to help diagnose any future issues
