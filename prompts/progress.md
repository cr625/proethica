# Progress Report: Switching to pgvector for Embeddings

## Overview

We have successfully switched the document embedding system to use pgvector for storing and querying vector embeddings. This change provides better performance and more accurate similarity search compared to the previous fallback approach.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Document Model**:
   - Changed the `embedding` column in the `DocumentChunk` model to use the `Vector` type from pgvector instead of `Text`
   - Removed the fallback approach where embeddings were stored as JSON strings

2. **Updated Embedding Service**:
   - Modified the `_store_chunks` method to store embeddings directly as vector types
   - Updated the `search_similar_chunks` method to use pgvector's native similarity search functionality
   - Removed the fallback similarity search implementation that used manual cosine distance calculation

3. **Database Migration**:
   - Created a migration script to drop and recreate the document_chunks table with the vector type
   - Added a vector similarity index for faster similarity search

4. **Testing**:
   - Created a simple test script to verify pgvector functionality
   - Confirmed that storing and querying vector embeddings works correctly

## Benefits

- **Improved Performance**: pgvector's native similarity search is much faster than the previous approach, especially as the number of documents grows
- **Better Accuracy**: Using pgvector's optimized vector operations ensures more accurate similarity search results
- **Reduced Complexity**: Removed the fallback code that was needed when pgvector wasn't available
- **Scalability**: The solution can now handle a larger number of documents efficiently

## Next Steps

- Consider adding more sophisticated indexing strategies as the document collection grows
- Explore pgvector's additional similarity metrics (Euclidean distance, inner product) for different use cases
- Optimize chunk size and overlap parameters for better search results
- Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed documents
