# Document Management and Embedding System Progress

## Overview

We've implemented a document management and embedding system that allows users to upload documents, process them for vector embeddings, and perform semantic search. This system enhances the AI Ethical DM platform by providing a way to search through guidelines, case studies, and other relevant documents.

## Components Implemented

1. **Document Model**
   - Created `Document` and `DocumentChunk` models in `app/models/document.py`
   - Documents store metadata, content, and file information
   - Document chunks store text segments with vector embeddings for similarity search

2. **Embedding Service**
   - Implemented in `app/services/embedding_service.py`
   - Uses Sentence-Transformers to generate embeddings
   - Provides text extraction from various file formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, HTML)
   - Implements text chunking with overlap for better semantic search
   - Supports both pgvector-based and fallback similarity search

3. **Document API Routes**
   - Implemented in `app/routes/documents.py`
   - Provides endpoints for document upload, retrieval, search, and management
   - Supports filtering by world and document type

4. **Database Integration**
   - Created tables for documents and document chunks
   - Added support for storing vector embeddings as JSON strings when pgvector is not available

## Current Status

- Basic document management functionality is implemented
- Document upload and processing works
- Semantic search is implemented with fallback for environments without pgvector
- API endpoints are available for integration with the frontend

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Integration**
   - Create UI components for document upload and search
   - Implement document browsing interface
   - Add search results visualization

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize chunking strategy for better search results
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed documents
   - Add batch processing for large document sets

3. **Enhanced Features**
   - Add support for more document formats
   - Implement document tagging and categorization
   - Add relevance feedback mechanism to improve search results
   - Integrate with the decision engine to provide relevant documents during scenario creation

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Create comprehensive test suite for document processing
   - Validate search quality with different document types
   - Benchmark performance with large document collections

## Technical Notes

- The system is designed to work with or without pgvector extension
- When pgvector is not available, a fallback similarity search using cosine distance is used
- Document chunks are stored with metadata to support filtering and ranking
- The embedding model used is all-MiniLM-L6-v2 with 384 dimensions
