# Simulation Timeline Progress

## Overview

This document outlines the progress made on the simulation timeline feature for the AI Ethical Decision-Making Simulator. The focus has been on simplifying the simulation flow and ensuring proper display of events, actions, and decisions from the database.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Simplified Simulation Start

- Removed character selection at the beginning of the simulation
- Replaced it with a simple "Begin Simulation" button
- Modified the initialization to use an "all perspectives" view by default

### 2. Timeline Display Enhancements

- Improved the timeline display to clearly show events, actions, and decisions
- Added visual indicators to distinguish between different types of events
- Ensured decisions are properly displayed in the timeline

### 3. Decision Point Handling

- Added a note about future branching implementation when decisions are made
- Maintained the ability to make decisions at decision points
- Ensured the simulation can progress through all events regardless of decisions

## Current Implementation

The current implementation allows users to:

1. Start a simulation with a single click
2. View a timeline of events that progressively reveals as they advance
3. Make decisions at decision points
4. See the ethical analysis of their decisions
5. Receive a note that in the future, decisions will create branches in the workflow

## Future Enhancements

1. **Branching Timeline**: Implement the ability for decisions to create branches in the timeline
2. **Character-Specific Views**: Re-implement the ability to view the simulation from specific character perspectives
3. **Decision Impact Visualization**: Add visual indicators of how decisions impact the timeline
4. **Timeline Navigation**: Add the ability to jump to specific points in the timeline

## Technical Notes

- The simulation state is stored in memory with a fallback to session storage
- Events, actions, and decisions are loaded from the database
- The timeline is updated dynamically as the user progresses through the simulation
- Decision points are identified by checking if an event has an associated action that is marked as a decision

## Testing

To test the current implementation:

1. Navigate to a scenario detail page
2. Click "Simulate Scenario"
3. Click "Begin Simulation"
4. Use the "Next" button to progress through the timeline
5. When encountering a decision point, select one of the options
6. Observe the ethical analysis and the note about future branching
7. Continue progressing through the timeline until the end
8. Optionally, save the simulation to review later
