# Embedding Model Implementation for AI Ethical Decision-Making Simulator

## Current Document Processing Needs

In the AI Ethical Decision-Making Simulator, I need to implement a robust system for processing, embedding, and retrieving information from ethical guidelines and uploaded documents. This system should enhance the application's ability to perform semantic search, find relevant guidelines for scenarios, and support the decision evaluation process.

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline

I need a pipeline that can:
- Accept various document formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- Extract text content preserving structure where possible
- Clean and preprocess the text
- Split documents into appropriate chunks for embedding
- Handle metadata extraction and preservation

### 2. Embedding Model Selection and Implementation

I need guidance on:
- Selecting appropriate embedding models for ethical text (e.g., OpenAI embeddings, Sentence Transformers, domain-specific models)
- Implementing efficient embedding generation
- Handling batch processing for large documents
- Storing embeddings efficiently in PostgreSQL or a vector database
- Updating embeddings when documents are modified

### 3. Retrieval System

The retrieval system should:
- Support semantic search across embedded documents
- Allow for similarity comparison between scenarios and guidelines
- Implement hybrid search (combining keyword and semantic search)
- Provide relevance scoring and ranking
- Support filtering by metadata (domain, source, date, etc.)

### 4. Integration with Existing Components

The embedding system needs to integrate with:
- The existing Zotero integration for academic references
- The MCP server for ontology data
- The LangChain-based decision engine
- The LangGraph-based event engine
- The Flask web application for user interaction

## Current Database Schema Considerations

The application currently uses PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy. I need to consider:
- How to store embeddings (PostgreSQL with pgvector extension vs. external vector DB)
- Schema changes needed to support document storage and retrieval
- Indexing strategies for efficient retrieval
- Versioning of documents and their embeddings

## User Experience Requirements

From a user perspective, the system should enable:
- Uploading new guidelines documents through the web interface
- Automatic processing and embedding of uploaded documents
- Searching across guidelines using natural language queries
- Viewing relevant guidelines when creating or evaluating scenarios
- Receiving guideline recommendations based on scenario content

## Implementation Approach

I'm considering using LangChain's document loading, text splitting, and retrieval components, but I need specific guidance on:
1. The most appropriate document loaders for different file types
2. Text splitting strategies for ethical guidelines
3. Embedding models that perform well on ethical content
4. Vector store options that integrate well with PostgreSQL
5. Retrieval patterns that work well with the existing application architecture

## Performance and Scalability Considerations

The implementation should address:
- Handling large documents efficiently
- Optimizing embedding generation and storage
- Ensuring fast retrieval times
- Scaling to accommodate growing document collections
- Managing computational resources effectively

## Evaluation Metrics

I want to evaluate the embedding system based on:
- Retrieval accuracy for relevant guidelines
- Processing time for document uploads
- Query response time
- Storage efficiency
- User satisfaction with search results

## Specific Questions

1. Which embedding model would be most appropriate for ethical guidelines across different domains (military, engineering, legal)?
2. Should I use a dedicated vector database or can I effectively use PostgreSQL with pgvector?
3. What chunking strategy would be most effective for ethical guidelines that often contain hierarchical information?
4. How should I handle document updates and versioning with respect to embeddings?
5. What retrieval techniques (MMR, reranking, etc.) would be most effective for this use case?
