# AI Ethical Decision-Making Simulator: Next Steps Planning Prompt

## Current Application Overview

I've developed an AI Ethical Decision-Making Simulator that simulates event-based scenarios (like military medical triage, engineering ethics, and legal ethics) to train and evaluate ethical decision-making agents. The system combines rule-based reasoning with case-based and analogical reasoning from domain-specific ethical guidelines.

### Current Architecture

- **Backend**: Flask, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL
- **AI Components**: Basic integration with LangChain and LangGraph
- **Extension**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) for ontology data
- **Reference Management**: Zotero integration for academic references

### Key Features

- Event-based simulation engine
- Character and resource management
- Decision tracking and evaluation
- Ethical reasoning framework
- World and scenario reference management
- Ontology-based knowledge representation

### Current Implementation

The application has:
1. A database schema with models for worlds, scenarios, characters, events, resources, etc.
2. A web interface for creating and managing scenarios
3. Basic decision evaluation using LangChain
4. Initial event processing using LangGraph
5. MCP server for ontology data access
6. Zotero integration for academic references

## Next Steps Planning

I'm looking to enhance the application with more advanced AI capabilities, specifically:

1. **Deeper LangChain and LangGraph Integration**: Expand the current basic implementation to create more sophisticated reasoning and simulation capabilities.

2. **Embedding Model for Document Analysis**: Implement a system to apply embedding models to uploaded documents and ethical guidelines to enable semantic search and similarity analysis.

## Specific Areas for Guidance

### 1. LangChain and LangGraph Enhancement

My current implementation uses:
- `DecisionEngine` class with LangChain for evaluating decisions against rules and ethics
- `EventEngine` class with LangGraph for processing events in scenarios

I need guidance on:
- Creating a more sophisticated agent architecture using LangChain
- Developing a more complex LangGraph workflow for scenario simulation
- Implementing memory and state management for long-running simulations
- Integrating tools and retrievers for accessing domain knowledge
- Building a more robust evaluation framework

### 2. Document Embedding System

I need to implement a system that:
- Processes uploaded documents (PDFs, DOCs, TXTs) containing ethical guidelines
- Applies embedding models to these documents
- Chunks and indexes the content for retrieval
- Enables semantic search across guidelines
- Supports similarity analysis between scenarios and guidelines
- Integrates with the existing Zotero reference management

## Technical Constraints

- The application is built with Python and Flask
- PostgreSQL is used for the database
- The system should be modular and extensible
- Performance considerations for embedding and retrieval operations
- Integration with existing MCP and Zotero components

## Expected Deliverables

Please provide:
1. A high-level architecture for the enhanced LangChain and LangGraph components
2. A detailed plan for implementing the document embedding system
3. Recommendations for specific LangChain and LangGraph components to use
4. Suggestions for embedding models suitable for ethical guidelines
5. Code structure and implementation approach
6. Potential challenges and mitigation strategies

## Additional Context

The application is designed to help users understand ethical decision-making in complex scenarios by providing:
- Simulation of ethical dilemmas
- Evaluation of decisions against established guidelines
- Reference to similar cases and academic literature
- Structured reasoning about ethical implications

The enhanced AI capabilities should maintain this focus while making the system more powerful and flexible.
