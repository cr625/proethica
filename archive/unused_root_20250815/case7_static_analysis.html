        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Engineer A, an experienced environmental engineer, faces ethical decisions about using open-source AI software for creating comprehensive environmental reports and AI-assisted drafting tools for engineering design documents. The case examines the boundaries of ethical AI use in professional engineering practice.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Issues:</strong> Competence requirements, confidentiality obligations, professional disclosure, and maintaining responsible charge over AI-assisted work.</p>
        
        <h2>Timeline Analysis</h2>

                <h3>üìÖ Initial Project Assignment</h3>
                <p><strong>Context:</strong> Client W Engagement</p>
                <p>Client W retains Engineer A to prepare a comprehensive report addressing the manufacture, use, and characteristics of an organic compound identified as an emerging contaminant of concern. Engineer A is also tasked with developing engineering design documents (plans and specifications) for modifications to groundwater infrastructure at the same site.</p>
                <p><em><strong>Background:</strong> Engineer A is an experienced environmental engineer with PE license and several years of experience, known for strong technical expertise but less confident in technical writing. Has been observing the site for over a year.</em></p>

                <h3>üìÖ Loss of Mentor Support</h3>
                <p><strong>Context:</strong> Professional Support Gap</p>
                <p>Engineer B, who previously provided guidance and quality assurance reviews to refine Engineer A's report drafts, recently retired and is no longer available in a work capacity.</p>
                <p><em><strong>Impact:</strong> Engineer A faces the challenge of delivering professional reports without the review and mentorship from Engineer B that they had previously relied upon.</em></p>

                <h3>üìÖ AI Technology Adoption Decision</h3>
                <p><strong>Context:</strong> Seeking Alternative Support</p>
                <p>Faced with the need to deliver both the report and engineering design documents without Engineer B's review, Engineer A opts to use open-source artificial intelligence (AI) software to create an initial draft of the necessary report and AI-assisted drafting tools to generate preliminary design documents.</p>
                <p><em><strong>Key Detail:</strong> The AI drafting software was new to the market and Engineer A had no previous experience with the tool. The AI software was open-source.</em></p>

                <p><strong>What Actually Happened:</strong> Engineer A gathered relevant information provided by Client W and relied on AI software to synthesize the information and generate an initial draft. After a few refining prompts, Engineer A received a first draft from the AI software. Engineer A then conducted a thorough review of the report, cross-checking key facts against professional journal articles, verifying phrasing through search engine queries to ensure no plagiarism, and making minor adjustments to personalize the content. Engineer A did not cite the use of AI software and submitted the draft to Client W with their professional seal.</p>

            <p>The NSPE Board of Ethical Review reached specific conclusions on each ethical question raised by Engineer A's use of AI in professional engineering practice:</p>
            
            <h3>Question 1: AI-Generated Report Text</h3>
            <p><strong>Finding:</strong> <span style="color: #ffc107;">PARTLY ETHICAL, PARTLY UNETHICAL</span></p>
            <p>"Engineer A's use of AI in report writing was partly ethical, and partly unethical. Engineer A was competent and did thoroughly review and verify the AI-generated content, ensuring accuracy and compliance with professional standards. However, Engineer A did not obtain client permission to disclose private information, nor did Engineer A document required technical citations. Ethical use of AI to create the report text must satisfy all pertinent requirements."</p>
            
            <h3>Question 2: AI-Assisted Design Documents</h3>
            <p><strong>Finding:</strong> <span style="color: #dc3545;">UNETHICAL</span></p>
            <p>"The use of AI-assisted drafting tools by Engineer A was not unethical per se. However, Engineer A's misuse of the tool, by failing to maintain Responsible Charge over the AI tool and its output before sealing the document and providing it to Client W, was unethical."</p>
            
            <h3>Question 3: Disclosure Obligations</h3>
            <p><strong>Finding:</strong> <span style="color: #28a745;">NO OBLIGATION, BUT BEST PRACTICE RECOMMENDED</span></p>
            <p>"Similar to other software used in the design or detailing process, Engineer A has no professional or ethical obligation to disclose AI use to Client W (unless such disclosure is required under Engineer A's contract with Client W). However, at the time of the BER's review of this case there is no universal guideline mandating AI disclosure in engineering work. Ethical principles favor transparency when AI plays a substantial role in generating work products."</p>
            
            <h3>Key Professional Lessons:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AI as Professional Tool:</strong> AI can be used ethically in engineering practice when proper professional standards are maintained</li>
                <li><strong>Responsible Charge Critical:</strong> Engineers must maintain active engagement and comprehensive oversight of AI-generated technical work</li>
                <li><strong>Confidentiality Paramount:</strong> Client consent required before sharing confidential information with AI systems</li>
                <li><strong>Attribution Necessary:</strong> Proper citations and documentation remain essential for AI-assisted work</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency as Best Practice:</strong> While not required, disclosure builds trust and demonstrates professional integrity</li>
