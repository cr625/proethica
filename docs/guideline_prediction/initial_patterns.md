# Initial Pattern Hypotheses for Case Outcome Prediction

**Date**: June 9, 2025  
**Source**: Analysis of NSPE ethics cases and guideline structure  
**Status**: Preliminary hypotheses for validation

## Key Pattern Hypotheses

### **H1: Public Safety Association Strength**
**Hypothesis**: Cases with strong associations to "Public Safety" guidelines will be classified as ethical if the engineer prioritizes public welfare, unethical if they compromise it.

**Pattern Indicators**:
- **High Public Safety + Action Taken** → Likely Ethical
- **High Public Safety + No Action** → Likely Unethical
- **Low Public Safety + Safety Issue Present** → Likely Unethical

**Validation Approach**: Compare public safety association strength with actual case outcomes where safety concerns are present.

### **H2: Professional Competence Boundary Patterns**
**Hypothesis**: Cases involving work outside professional competence area correlate strongly with unethical outcomes.

**Pattern Indicators**:
- **High Competence Association + Boundary Respected** → Likely Ethical
- **High Competence Association + Boundary Exceeded** → Likely Unethical
- **Technical Complexity + Competence Mismatch** → Strong Unethical Signal

**Validation Approach**: Identify cases with competence boundary issues and test association patterns.

### **H3: Communication Ethics Correlation**
**Hypothesis**: Strong associations with honesty/truthfulness guidelines correlate with outcome based on whether communication was transparent or deceptive.

**Pattern Indicators**:
- **High Honesty Association + Transparent Communication** → Likely Ethical
- **High Honesty Association + Deceptive Communication** → Likely Unethical
- **Missing Information + Honesty Required** → Context-dependent

**Validation Approach**: Analyze communication-focused cases for transparency vs. deception patterns.

### **H4: Conflicting Loyalties Decision Pattern**
**Hypothesis**: Cases with competing loyalties (employer vs. public) show predictable patterns based on which loyalty the engineer prioritizes.

**Pattern Indicators**:
- **High Loyalty Association + Public Priority** → Likely Ethical
- **High Loyalty Association + Employer Priority** → Context-dependent
- **Fiduciary Duty + Public Safety Conflict** → Requires Analysis

**Validation Approach**: Examine cases with explicit loyalty conflicts for decision patterns.

## Section-Level Pattern Analysis

### **Facts Section Patterns**
**Hypothesis**: Certain fact patterns correlate with outcomes regardless of engineer's actions.

**Risk Indicators** (suggesting potential for unethical outcome):
- Safety concerns mentioned
- Competence boundaries unclear
- Economic pressure present
- Multiple stakeholder interests
- Incomplete information scenarios

**Protective Indicators** (suggesting potential for ethical outcome):
- Clear competence alignment
- Transparent communication context
- Public safety prioritized
- Professional standards referenced

### **Discussion Section Patterns**
**Hypothesis**: The reasoning approach in discussion sections predicts the outcome.

**Ethical Reasoning Patterns**:
- NSPE Code explicitly referenced
- Multiple perspectives considered
- Public welfare prioritized
- Professional standards applied
- Risk assessment included

**Unethical Reasoning Patterns**:
- Professional standards ignored
- Single-perspective analysis
- Economic factors prioritized over safety
- Competence limitations not acknowledged
- Public welfare not considered

### **Conclusion Section Patterns**
**Hypothesis**: The decision framework used in conclusions is the strongest predictor of ethical classification.

**Ethical Decision Indicators**:
- Public safety prioritized
- Professional competence respected
- Transparent communication maintained
- Professional standards followed
- Stakeholder welfare considered

**Unethical Decision Indicators**:
- Public safety compromised
- Competence boundaries exceeded
- Deceptive communication
- Professional standards violated
- Self-interest prioritized

## Guideline Association Strength Hypotheses

### **High-Impact Guidelines** (Strong Outcome Correlation)
1. **Public Safety Paramount**: Direct correlation with ethical/unethical classification
2. **Professional Competence**: Strong predictor when competence boundaries involved
3. **Honesty and Integrity**: High correlation with communication-based cases
4. **Confidentiality**: Strong predictor in information disclosure scenarios

### **Medium-Impact Guidelines** (Moderate Correlation)
1. **Fiduciary Duty**: Context-dependent correlation
2. **Professional Development**: Background factor
3. **Legal Compliance**: Important but context-specific
4. **Environmental Responsibility**: Domain-specific correlation

### **Low-Impact Guidelines** (Weak Direct Correlation)
1. **Professional Courtesy**: Rarely determinative
2. **Professional Reputation**: Consequence rather than cause
3. **Conflict of Interest**: Important when present, but not always present

## Confidence Scoring Hypotheses

### **High Confidence Patterns** (>80% certainty)
- Clear public safety violation with no action taken
- Work performed far outside competence area
- Explicit deceptive communication
- Direct NSPE Code violation with no mitigating factors

### **Medium Confidence Patterns** (50-80% certainty)
- Competing priorities with reasonable arguments
- Professional judgment calls under uncertainty
- Minor competence boundary questions
- Communication transparency issues

### **Low Confidence Patterns** (<50% certainty)
- Complex multi-stakeholder scenarios
- Novel situations not well-covered by guidelines
- Cultural or contextual factors affecting interpretation
- Incomplete information scenarios

## Case Similarity Patterns

### **Similarity Indicators**
1. **Guideline Association Overlap**: Similar sets of triggered guidelines
2. **Section Type Similarity**: Similar patterns in facts/discussion/conclusion
3. **Decision Factor Similarity**: Similar ethical trade-offs involved
4. **Stakeholder Pattern Similarity**: Similar stakeholder configurations

### **Dissimilarity Indicators**
1. **Domain Differences**: Different engineering disciplines
2. **Scale Differences**: Individual vs. organizational level decisions
3. **Temporal Differences**: Immediate vs. long-term consequences
4. **Regulatory Differences**: Different legal/regulatory contexts

## Prediction Algorithm Design Hypotheses

### **Weighted Association Approach**
```python
outcome_score = (
    public_safety_weight * public_safety_association +
    competence_weight * competence_association +
    honesty_weight * honesty_association +
    ...
) * section_type_modifier * confidence_adjustment
```

### **Pattern Matching Approach**
```python
for known_pattern in ethical_patterns:
    similarity = calculate_similarity(case_associations, pattern)
    if similarity > threshold:
        return pattern.outcome_prediction
```

### **Ensemble Approach**
```python
predictions = [
    weighted_association_prediction(),
    pattern_matching_prediction(),
    case_similarity_prediction()
]
return ensemble_combine(predictions)
```

## Validation Experimental Design

### **Baseline Experiments**
1. **Random Classification**: 50% accuracy baseline
2. **Simple Keyword Matching**: Basic text analysis
3. **Single Guideline Correlation**: Test individual guideline predictive power

### **Progressive Complexity**
1. **Single Section Analysis**: Facts only, then discussion only, then conclusion only
2. **Multi-Section Integration**: Combine section-level predictions
3. **Full Association Analysis**: Use complete guideline association patterns

### **Cross-Validation Strategy**
1. **Case-Level Split**: Ensure no data leakage between training/test
2. **Temporal Split**: Use older cases for training, newer for testing
3. **Domain Split**: Use different engineering disciplines for testing

## Risk Mitigation

### **Overfitting Prevention**
- Use cross-validation throughout development
- Maintain separate test set until final evaluation
- Focus on interpretable patterns over complex models

### **Bias Detection**
- Check for domain-specific biases
- Validate across different case types
- Ensure balanced representation of outcomes

### **Quality Assurance**
- Manual review of prediction reasoning
- Expert validation of pattern hypotheses
- Iterative refinement based on validation results

## Expected Validation Timeline

### **Week 1-2**: Basic Pattern Validation
