# Case Outcome Taxonomy

**Date**: June 9, 2025  
**Source**: Analysis of 30 NSPE ethics cases with outcome data

## Outcome Classifications

### **Primary Categories**

#### **Ethical** (16 cases, 53%)
Cases where the engineering actions are deemed ethically appropriate and compliant with professional standards.

**Characteristics**:
- Actions align with NSPE Code of Ethics
- Public safety, health, and welfare prioritized
- Professional competence maintained
- Honest and transparent communication
- Appropriate confidentiality and loyalty

**Example Cases**:
- Case where engineer reports safety concerns to authorities
- Case where engineer refuses to perform work outside competence area
- Case where engineer maintains client confidentiality appropriately

#### **Unethical** (14 cases, 47%)
Cases where the engineering actions violate professional ethical standards.

**Characteristics**:
- NSPE Code violations identified
- Public safety, health, or welfare compromised
- Professional competence exceeded or misrepresented
- Dishonest or misleading communication
- Inappropriate breaches of confidentiality or loyalty

**Example Cases**:
- Case where engineer fails to report known safety hazards
- Case where engineer works outside area of competence
- Case where engineer makes false or misleading statements

#### **Outcome Not Specified** (3 cases, 10%)
Cases presented for analysis without predetermined ethical judgment.

**Purpose**: 
- Educational scenarios for discussion
- Complex cases with multiple valid perspectives
- Cases designed to teach ethical reasoning process

## Outcome Storage Format

### **Database Storage**
```json
{
  "outcome": "ethical" | "unethical" | "outcome not specified",
  "case_number": "XX-XX",
  "title": "Case Title",
  "ethical_analysis": {
    "principles_involved": [...],
    "reasoning": "...",
    "decision_factors": [...]
  }
}
```

### **Validation Rules**
- Outcome must be one of three specified values
- Case number should follow NSPE format (XX-XX)
- Ethical analysis section should provide reasoning

## Ethical Reasoning Patterns

### **Common Decision Factors**

#### **For Ethical Outcomes**
1. **Public Safety Prioritized**: Engineer puts public welfare first
2. **Competence Boundaries Respected**: Work performed within expertise
3. **Transparency Maintained**: Honest communication with stakeholders
4. **Professional Standards Followed**: NSPE Code adhered to
5. **Appropriate Disclosure**: Safety concerns reported when required

#### **For Unethical Outcomes**
1. **Public Safety Compromised**: Failure to prioritize public welfare
2. **Competence Exceeded**: Work performed outside expertise area
3. **Deceptive Practices**: Misleading or false communications
4. **Professional Standards Violated**: NSPE Code breaches
5. **Inappropriate Secrecy**: Failure to disclose safety concerns

### **Complexity Factors**

#### **Gray Area Indicators**
- Competing loyalties (employer vs. public)
- Incomplete information scenarios
- Multiple valid ethical frameworks
- Economic vs. safety trade-offs
- Legal vs. ethical obligations

#### **Case Difficulty Markers**
- Multiple stakeholders with conflicting interests
- Long-term vs. short-term consequence trade-offs
- Professional judgment calls under uncertainty
- Balancing confidentiality with disclosure obligations

## Prediction Target Design

### **Binary Classification**
**Primary Target**: Ethical vs. Unethical (87% of cases)
- Clear decision boundary
- Sufficient data for training
- Aligns with professional practice needs

**Confidence Scoring**: 
- High confidence: Clear NSPE Code alignment/violation
- Medium confidence: Professional judgment required
- Low confidence: Complex trade-offs, gray areas

### **Multi-class Classification** (Future)
**Extended Targets**: 
- Ethical
- Unethical  
- Requires Further Analysis
- Context Dependent

### **Reasoning Classification** (Advanced)
**Decision Factor Tags**:
- Public safety violation
- Competence boundary issue
- Communication ethics
- Confidentiality breach
- Professional loyalty conflict

## Integration with Guideline Associations

### **Prediction Logic**
```python
def predict_case_outcome(case_sections, guideline_associations):
    """
    Predict case outcome based on guideline association patterns.
    
    High correlation patterns:
    - Strong "Public Safety" associations → Likely ethical if prioritized
    - Strong "Competence" associations → Check boundary respect
    - Strong "Honesty" associations → Check communication transparency
    """
    return {
        'predicted_outcome': 'ethical|unethical',
        'confidence': 0.0-1.0,
        'key_factors': [...],
        'similar_cases': [...]
    }
```

### **Association Weighting**
- **High Impact Guidelines**: Public Safety, Professional Competence
- **Medium Impact Guidelines**: Honesty, Confidentiality, Loyalty
- **Context Guidelines**: Professional Development, Industry Standards

## Validation Strategy

### **Cross-Validation Approach**
1. **Training Set**: 20 cases (67%) for pattern learning
2. **Validation Set**: 5 cases (17%) for parameter tuning
3. **Test Set**: 5 cases (17%) for final accuracy assessment

### **Success Metrics**
- **Primary**: >70% binary classification accuracy
- **Secondary**: Confidence calibration quality
- **Tertiary**: Reasoning explanation quality

### **Error Analysis**
- False positives: Predicted ethical, actually unethical
- False negatives: Predicted unethical, actually ethical
- Confidence miscalibration: High confidence, wrong prediction

## Implementation Notes

### **Data Quality**
- All outcomes manually verified against NSPE standards
- Consistent reasoning documentation
- Clear decision factor identification

### **Extensibility**
- Schema supports additional outcome types
- Reasoning taxonomy can be expanded
- Confidence scoring framework scalable

### **Integration Points**
- Compatible with existing case processing pipeline
- Aligns with guideline concept types
- Supports section-level association analysis

## Future Enhancements

### **Outcome Refinement**
- Sub-categories within ethical/unethical
- Severity scoring for violations
- Context-dependent outcome modeling

### **Reasoning Enhancement**
- Automated reasoning extraction
- Decision tree visualization
- Counterfactual analysis ("what if" scenarios)

### **Validation Expansion**
- External expert validation
- Inter-rater reliability testing
- Longitudinal accuracy tracking
