# Guidelines

This guide covers browsing and using ethical guidelines in ProEthica.

## Overview

Guidelines are the codes of ethics that govern professional conduct within each domain. In ProEthica, guidelines provide the normative foundation against which cases are analyzed.

## Accessing Guidelines

Navigate to: **Guidelines** in the navigation bar

Or direct URL: `/guidelines/`

## Guidelines by Domain

Guidelines are organized by professional domain (e.g., Engineering Ethics). Each domain contains:

- **Code of Ethics** - The governing professional standards
- **Sections** - Numbered provisions within the code
- **Case References** - Cases that cite specific provisions

### Engineering Ethics

For engineering ethics, the primary guideline is the **NSPE Code of Ethics for Engineers**. This code contains:

| Section | Topic |
|---------|-------|
| I. Fundamental Canons | Core professional duties |
| II. Rules of Practice | Specific requirements |
| III. Professional Obligations | Relationship duties |
