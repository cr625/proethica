# Phase 2: Case Synthesis

This guide covers Step 4 case synthesis, which analyzes extracted entities to produce structured case analysis.

## Overview

Step 4 performs four-phase synthesis on the entities extracted during Phase 1 (Steps 1-3):

| Phase | Name | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| 1 | Entity Foundation | Prepared entity data for analysis |
| 2 | Analytical Extraction | Provisions, questions, conclusions |
| 3 | Decision Point Synthesis | Identified decision points |
| 4 | Narrative Construction | Case narrative with Toulmin arguments |

## Prerequisites

Before running Step 4:

- Step 1 (Contextual Framework) must be complete
- Step 2 (Normative Requirements) must be complete
- Step 3 (Temporal Dynamics) must be complete

## Starting Step 4

### Access the Pipeline

Navigate to the case detail page and click the **Step 4** button. The button appears green if prerequisites are met.

### Four-Phase Process

Step 4 runs automatically through all four phases:

**Phase 1: Entity Foundation**
Prepares extracted entities from Steps 1-3 for analysis.

**Phase 2: Analytical Extraction**
Extracts from the case text:

- Code of ethics provisions cited
- Ethical questions posed to the board
- Board conclusions and determinations

**Phase 3: Decision Point Synthesis**
Identifies decision points where ethical choices were made or could have been made differently.

**Phase 4: Narrative Construction**
Builds a structured narrative including:

- Timeline of events and actions
- Toulmin-structured arguments for decisions
- Transformation classification (transfer, stalemate, oscillation, phase lag)

## Reviewing Results

After Step 4 completes, the review page displays:

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Provisions** | Code sections cited with relevance |
| **Questions** | Ethical questions with linked conclusions |
| **Decision Points** | Key decision moments with alternatives |
| **Narrative** | Structured case summary |

## Transformation Types

Step 4 classifies the case transformation pattern:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Transfer** | Stable resolution with clear outcome |
| **Stalemate** | Unresolved competing obligations |
| **Oscillation** | Alternating between positions |
| **Phase Lag** | Delayed recognition of ethical issue |

See [Transformation Types](../reference/transformation-types.md) for detailed definitions.
