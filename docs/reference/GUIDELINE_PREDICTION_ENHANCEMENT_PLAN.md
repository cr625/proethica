# Guideline Association Enhancement Plan
## Transform Ethical Guidelines into Case Outcome Prediction System

### Overview
This plan outlines the phased approach to enhance the existing Ethical Guideline Associations to become a predictive system for case outcomes. The goal is to identify patterns in how ethical principles relate to case decisions and use these patterns to predict outcomes of new cases.

### Current State
- **Guideline Associations**: Connect document sections with ethical principles using semantic analysis
- **Confidence Scores**: Measure how strongly a section relates to a guideline
- **Reasoning Chains**: Explain why associations were made
- **Missing**: Connection to actual case outcomes and predictive capabilities

### Target State
- **Outcome-Aware Associations**: Patterns that correlate with specific case outcomes
- **Predictive Confidence**: Probability of specific outcomes based on guideline patterns
- **Historical Validation**: Learn from past cases to improve predictions
- **Case Similarity**: Find similar cases based on guideline association patterns

   - Create outcome taxonomy
   - Document outcome storage locations
   - Build case outcome statistics

3. **Initial Pattern Analysis**

     # New fields for prediction
     "outcome_patterns": {
       "violation_correlation": 0.78,
       "no_violation_correlation": 0.22,
       "historical_cases": [252, 187, 91],
