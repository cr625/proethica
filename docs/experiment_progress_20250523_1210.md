## Date/Time Group: 2025-05-23 12:10

### **âœ… MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: All Critical Issues RESOLVED**

#### **ðŸŸ¢ COMPLETED: Comprehensive Mock Data Overhaul**
- **Problem**: Military medical triage content persisted throughout multiple mock data sources - **FULLY RESOLVED**
- **Comprehensive Solution Applied**:
  - âœ… **LLMService**: Updated all 6 mock responses to focus on engineering ethics and Case 252 scenarios
  - âœ… **DecisionEngine**: Replaced 2 mock responses with engineering ethics standards and NSPE Code references
  - âœ… **Enhanced DecisionEngine**: Fixed fallback logic to default to engineering-ethics
  - âœ… **Default Domain Logic**: Changed system-wide default from "military-medical-triage" to "engineering-ethics"
  - âœ… **Content Verification**: All responses now mention engineering, professional responsibility, design integrity
- **Verification Results**: âœ… ALL TESTS PASSED
  - Case 252 simulation shows proper engineering ethics content
  - No military/medical content remains in any mock responses
  - Default domain correctly set to engineering-ethics
  - Mock responses specifically address design error scenarios

#### **ðŸŸ¢ COMPLETED: Critical Database Fix**
- **Problem**: `experiment_run_id` cannot be NULL in `experiment_predictions` table - **FIXED**
- **Solution Applied**: 
  - âœ… Executed SQL migration: `ALTER TABLE experiment_predictions ALTER COLUMN experiment_run_id DROP NOT NULL;`
  - âœ… Verified model definitions show `nullable=True` for all `experiment_run_id` fields
  - âœ… Database constraint blocking formal experiments is now resolved

### **ðŸŽ¯ NEXT IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Case 252 End-to-End Testing**

#### **ðŸŸ¢ READY FOR TESTING: Case 252 "Acknowledging Errors in Design"**
- **Case ID**: 252
- **Title**: "Acknowledging Errors in Design" 
- **Target URLs**:
  - Case View: http://127.0.0.1:3333/cases/252
  - Experiment Dashboard: http://127.0.0.1:3333/experiment/
  - Quick Prediction Test: Ready to execute
- **Mock Content Preview**: 
  ```
  "I understand you're looking at an engineering ethics scenario. This appears to involve 
  questions about professional responsibility, design integrity, and public safety. Engineers 
  must balance technical constraints, economic pressures, and ethical obligations to ensure 
  public welfare. In this case, the key question appears to be how to properly acknowledge 
  and address design errors while maintaining professional integrity. Would you like me to 
  explain how the NSPE Code of Ethics applies to this situation?"
