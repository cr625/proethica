# Section Embeddings Error Fix Summary

## Issue
The error "'str' object has no attribute 'keys'" occurs when clicking "Generate Section Embeddings" button.

## Root Cause
The document metadata structure sometimes contains string values where dictionaries are expected, particularly in the `document_structure.sections` field. This can happen when:
- Documents were processed with older versions of the code
- JSON serialization/deserialization issues
- Metadata corruption during storage

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Route Handler Enhancement (`/app/routes/document_structure.py`)
- Added metadata validation to ensure it's loaded as a dictionary
- Added checks for required structure elements (document_structure, structure_triples)
- Improved error messages for common issues
- Added AJAX support for better UX

### 2. Frontend Enhancement (`/app/templates/document_structure.html`)
- Added AJAX form submission with loading state
- Added inline error display
- Improved user feedback with specific error messages

### 3. Service Layer Protection
The `section_embedding_service.py` already had proper type checking in place to handle this scenario.

## Result
Users now get:
- Clear error messages when metadata is corrupted
- Instructions to regenerate document structure if needed
- Better loading states and error handling
- No more cryptic Python errors

## Next Steps
With the error fixed, we can now proceed with implementing granular section embeddings as outlined in the enhancement plan.
