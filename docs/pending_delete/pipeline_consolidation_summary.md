# Case URL Processing Pipeline Consolidation

## Summary of Changes (2025-01-24)

### Problem
The ProEthica system had duplicate implementations for processing cases from URLs:
1. Main pipeline at `/cases/process/url` (missing document structure annotation)
2. Enhanced pipeline at `/cases_enhanced/process/url` (included document structure)
3. Unused `CaseUrlProcessor` service mentioned in documentation

### Solution
Consolidated all functionality into the main pipeline at `/cases/process/url`.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated Main Pipeline (`app/routes/cases.py`)
- Added `DocumentStructureAnnotationStep` to the pipeline
- Included document structure metadata in the saved document
- Added section embeddings metadata support
- Improved logging with pipeline step information
- Enhanced success messages to indicate when structure annotation is included

#### 2. Deprecated Enhanced Route
- Commented out blueprint registration in `app/__init__.py`
- Added deprecation notice to `cases_structure_update.py`
- Preserved file for reference

#### 3. Metadata Structure
Documents now save with the following metadata structure (per CLAUDE.md):
```json
{
  "case_number": "23-4",
  "year": "2023",
  "pdf_url": "...",
  "sections": {...},
  "questions_list": [...],
  "conclusion_items": [...],
  "document_structure": {
    "document_uri": "http://proethica.org/document/case_23_4",
    "structure_triples": "...",
    "sections": {...},
    "annotation_timestamp": "2025-01-24T..."
  },
  "section_embeddings_metadata": {...}
}
```

### Benefits
1. **Single source of truth**: One pipeline implementation to maintain
2. **Feature parity**: All cases now get document structure annotation
3. **Cleaner codebase**: Removed duplicate code
4. **Better logging**: Clear pipeline execution logs
5. **Consistent metadata**: Follows CLAUDE.md structure

### Next Steps
1. Test the consolidated pipeline with various NSPE case URLs
2. Consider integrating the `CaseUrlProcessor` for advanced features
3. Add batch processing capabilities
4. Improve error handling and user feedback

### Testing Instructions
To test the consolidated pipeline:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3333/cases/new/url
2. Enter an NSPE case URL
3. Check "Process extraction" option
4. Submit and verify:
   - Case is extracted with all sections
   - Success message mentions "with document structure annotation"
   - Database record contains `document_structure` in metadata
