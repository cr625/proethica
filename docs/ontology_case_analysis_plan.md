# Ontology-Based Case Analysis Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the ontology-based case analysis functionality in ProEthica, focusing on leveraging the engineering ethics ontology for enhanced case reasoning.

## Overview

The ontology-based case analysis system aims to operationalize McLaren's methodology for engineering ethics case analysis, as detailed in McLaren's 2003 paper. The system will use formal ontology knowledge to analyze engineering ethics cases, extract relevant ethical principles, and represent cases temporally for comparison and reasoning.

## Architecture

The implementation follows a modular architecture with the following components:

1. **Unified Ontology Server**: Provides ontology access and query capabilities
2. **Case Analysis Module**: Extracts ontology entities from cases and performs analysis 
3. **Database Layer**: Stores case analysis results and relationships
4. **API Integration**: Connects the Flask application to the ontology system
5. **User Interface**: Visualizes case analysis results

## Database Schema

The following tables have been implemented to support case analysis:

- `case_analysis`: Stores overall analysis results for a case
- `case_entities`: Tracks ontology entities found in cases
- `case_temporal_elements`: Represents the temporal structure of cases
- `case_principles`: Links ethical principles to cases
- `case_principle_instantiations`: Tracks how principles are instantiated in cases
- `case_relationships`: Stores relationships between cases based on ontology analysis

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup ✓

1. **Unified Ontology Server Setup** ✓
   - Implement modular server architecture
   - Create query and case analysis modules
   - Configure server on port 5002

2. **Database Schema Creation** ✓
   - Design and implement database tables
   - Create migration scripts
   - Add indexes for performance

3. **API Integration** ✓
   - Implement Flask routes for ontology access
   - Create verification endpoints
   - Set up proper error handling

### Phase 2: Case Analysis Implementation

1. **Entity Extraction**
   - Implement NLP-based entity extraction from case text
   - Link extracted entities to ontology concepts
   - Create confidence scoring for extracted entities

2. **Temporal Representation**
   - Parse case text into temporal sequences
   - Identify events, actions, and decisions
   - Create temporal relationships between elements

3. **Principle Identification**
   - Extract relevant ethical principles from ontology
   - Link principles to case elements
   - Identify potential violations or adherences

### Phase 3: Case Transformation

1. **Case to Scenario Transformation**
   - Convert analyzed cases into interactive scenarios
   - Create decision points based on ethical principles
   - Generate alternative paths based on different decisions

2. **Simulation Integration**
   - Link scenarios to the simulation engine
   - Enable "what-if" analysis based on different decisions
   - Create feedback mechanisms for learning

### Phase 4: Analysis and Visualization

1. **Pattern Matching**
   - Implement algorithms to find similarities between cases
   - Create ontology-based similarity metrics
   - Enable case-based reasoning

2. **Visualization**
   - Create timeline visualizations of cases
   - Implement network graphs of related entities
   - Develop principle violation/adherence visualizations

3. **Reporting**
   - Generate comprehensive analysis reports
   - Include ethical principle explanations
   - Provide recommendations based on similar cases

## McLaren's Methodology Integration

The implementation will apply McLaren's approach to computationally represent engineering ethics cases:

1. **Extensional Definitions**: Using concrete examples to define ethical principles
2. **Case Representation**: Representing cases as temporally ordered collections of facts
3. **Precedent-Based Reasoning**: Finding similarities between cases to guide ethical analysis
4. **Operationalization**: Making abstract principles concrete through specific case examples

## Technical Components

### Unified Ontology Server

The unified ontology server runs on port 5002 and exposes the following key endpoints:

- `/info` - Server information and available tools
- `/rpc` - JSON-RPC endpoint for calling methods
- `/api/entities/{ontology}` - Direct access to entities in an ontology

### Case Analysis Module

The case analysis module provides these tools via the JSON-RPC interface:

- `analyze_case` - Perform full analysis of a case
- `extract_entities` - Extract ontology entities from case text
- `get_temporal_representation` - Create temporal representation of a case
- `find_similar_cases` - Find cases similar to a given case

### Flask Integration

The Flask application exposes these routes for ontology interaction:

- `/api/ontology/status` - Verify connection to ontology server
- `/api/ontology/tools` - List available tools
- `/api/ontology/query` - Execute SPARQL queries
- `/api/ontology/entity/{id}` - Get entity details
- `/api/ontology/analyze_case/{id}` - Analyze a case

## Usage Examples

### Case Analysis

```python
# Python example of case analysis
import requests

# Analyze a case
response = requests.get('http://localhost:5000/api/ontology/analyze_case/123')
analysis = response.json()

# Extract entities found in the case
entities = analysis['entities']
principles = analysis['principles']
temporal_elements = analysis['temporal_elements']

# Find similar cases
similar_cases = analysis['similar_cases']
```

### SPARQL Query

```sparql
# SPARQL query example to find relevant principles
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX eng: <http://proethica.org/ontology/engineering-ethics#>

SELECT ?principle ?label ?description
WHERE {
  ?principle rdf:type eng:Principle .
  ?principle rdfs:label ?label .
  OPTIONAL { ?principle rdfs:comment ?description }
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Complete the case analysis functionality
2. Develop the temporal representation system
3. Implement entity extraction algorithms
4. Create visualization components
5. Integrate with the simulation system
