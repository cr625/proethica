# Ontology-Based Case Analysis Enhancement Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for enhancing ProEthica's ontology capabilities with a specific focus on case analysis functionality. This enhancement builds upon the realm-integration branch, focusing on the ontology portion of the system.

## Key Components

1. **Unified Ontology Server**: Central server managing ontology access and operations
2. **Case Analysis Module**: Specialized module for analyzing ethics cases using ontologies
3. **Temporal Ontology Support**: Handling of time-based relationships in ethical scenarios
4. **Query Interface**: Enhanced querying capabilities for ontology-based analysis

## Implementation Details

### 1. Unified Ontology Server

The unified ontology server acts as a central point for ontology operations:

- **Port Configuration**: Uses port 5002 to avoid conflicts with other services
- **Module System**: Dynamically loads specialized ontology modules
- **API Endpoints**: Standardized endpoints for consistent access

### 2. Case Analysis Module

The case analysis module provides specialized functionality:

- **Case-to-Ontology Mapping**: Maps case elements to ontology concepts
- **Ethical Principle Extraction**: Identifies ethical principles in case descriptions
- **Decision Analysis**: Analyzes decisions in the context of ethical frameworks

### 3. Temporal Ontology Support

Temporal support enables time-based reasoning:

- **Event Sequencing**: Tracks sequence of events in ethical scenarios
- **Temporal Relationships**: Represents before/after relationships between entities
- **Causal Analysis**: Supports analysis of cause and effect in ethical cases

### 4. Query Interface

Enhanced query capabilities include:

- **Natural Language Queries**: Support for natural language questions about cases
- **Pattern Matching**: Identification of common ethical patterns across cases
- **Cross-Ontology Queries**: Ability to query across multiple ontology sources

## Technical Challenges Addressed

1. **URL Formatting Issues**: Fixed escape sequence problems (`\x3a`) in URLs
2. **Blueprint Conflicts**: Resolved conflicts between multiple ontology blueprints
3. **Port Configurations**: Standardized port usage to avoid conflicts
4. **Module Loading**: Implemented dynamic loading of specialized modules

## Development Roadmap

1. **Phase 1**: Core infrastructure setup (completed)
   - Fix URL formatting issues
   - Resolve blueprint conflicts
   - Configure ports properly

2. **Phase 2**: Case analysis integration (in progress)
   - Implement case-to-ontology mapping
   - Develop ethical principle extraction
   - Create specialized query interfaces

3. **Phase 3**: Advanced features (planned)
   - Temporal reasoning capabilities
   - Cross-ontology analysis
   - Recommendation generation

## Integration with ProEthica

This enhancement integrates with ProEthica by:

1. Working alongside the realm integration
2. Enhancing the existing ontology system
3. Providing specialized endpoints for case analysis
4. Supporting advanced reasoning about ethical scenarios

## Usage

To use the ontology-based case analysis:

1. Start the unified ontology server:
   ```bash
   ./start_unified_ontology_server.sh
   ```

2. Access case analysis through API endpoints:
   ```
   http://localhost:5002/api/ontology/case-analysis
   ```

3. Query ethical principles:
   ```
   http://localhost:5002/api/ontology/principles?case=<case_id>
   ```
