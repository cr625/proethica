# Type Mapping Logic Implementation Tracker

## Project Overview
**Goal**: Implement intelligent type mapping that preserves LLM insights and enables ontology expansion instead of forcing all invalid types to "state".

**Problem**: Current system defaults all invalid LLM-suggested types to "state", losing valuable semantic insights.

**Solution**: Multi-phase implementation of flexible type mapping with human review and ontology expansion capabilities.

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** (2025-01-08)  
**Actual Duration**: 1 day  
**Dependencies**: None

#### Tasks
- [x] **P1.1** - Create `GuidelineConceptTypeMapper` service
  - [x] Basic service structure with semantic mapping dictionary
  - [x] Four-level mapping strategy implementation
  - [x] Confidence scoring system
- [x] **P1.2** - Implement semantic similarity matching
  - [x] Common type mappings (e.g., "Professional Standard" → "principle")
  - [x] Description-based inference logic
  - [x] Parent type suggestion for new types
- [x] **P1.3** - Unit tests for type mapping logic
  - [x] Test known mappings
  - [x] Test edge cases and new type detection
  - [x] Confidence score validation

#### Deliverables
- ✅ `app/services/guideline_concept_type_mapper.py` (377 lines)
- ✅ `tests/test_guideline_concept_type_mapper.py` (11 comprehensive test cases)
- ✅ Initial semantic mapping dictionary (60+ mappings)

#### Success Criteria
- ✅ Service correctly maps known type variants to core 8 types
- ✅ Identifies genuinely new types with reasonable confidence
- ✅ Suggests appropriate parent types for new concepts
- ✅ All tests pass (11/11 passing)

#### Key Features Implemented
- **Four-Level Mapping Strategy**:
  1. Exact match to core types (100% confidence)
  2. Semantic similarity mapping (80-95% confidence)
  3. Description-based inference (50-90% confidence)
  4. New type proposal with parent suggestion (60% confidence)

- **Comprehensive Semantic Mappings**: 60+ LLM type variants mapped to core 8 types
- **Intelligent Parent Suggestions**: Context-aware parent type suggestions for new concepts
- **Fuzzy String Matching**: Handles plurals, misspellings, and variations
- **Description Analysis**: Keyword-based inference using regex patterns
- **Confidence Scoring**: Transparent confidence levels for all mapping decisions

#### Test Results with Guideline 13 Examples
All 15 concept types from guideline 13 now map correctly:
- "Fundamental Principle" → principle (95% confidence)
- "Professional Duty" → obligation (95% confidence) 
- "Professional Relationship" → role (85% confidence)
- "Professional Growth" → action (60% confidence)
- "Social Justice" → principle (60% confidence)
- And 10 more accurate mappings

  - `pending_concept_types`: 11 columns with status workflow (pending/approved/rejected)
  - `custom_concept_types`: 8 columns for approved custom types with ontology URIs
  - `concept_type_mappings`: 10 columns for tracking mapping decisions and usage

- **Performance optimizations**:
  - 6 new indexes for efficient querying
