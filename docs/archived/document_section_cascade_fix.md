# Document Section Cascade Delete Fix

## Issue Summary
When attempting to delete documents with associated document sections, the application was encountering foreign key constraint violations. This was happening because when a Document was deleted, its associated DocumentSection records were not being automatically deleted, causing orphaned sections in the database.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified in the relationship definition between Document and DocumentSection models. The cascade delete relationship was incorrectly set up in the DocumentSection model:

```python
# Original, incorrect relationship in DocumentSection model
document = db.relationship('Document', backref='document_sections', cascade='all, delete-orphan')
```

The problem with this setup is that it defined the cascade direction incorrectly. The `cascade='all, delete-orphan'` option was placed on the "many" side of the one-to-many relationship, but it should be defined on the "one" side to properly cascade deletions from the parent to the children.

## Solution
The relationship was corrected by modifying the DocumentSection model to use a backref with the cascade option:

```python
# Fixed relationship in DocumentSection model
document = db.relationship('Document', backref=db.backref('document_sections', cascade='all, delete-orphan'))
```

With this change, when a Document is deleted, SQLAlchemy will automatically delete all associated DocumentSection records. This ensures database integrity and prevents orphaned sections.

## Testing
The fix was tested using multiple approaches:

1. **Manual cleanup script**: We initially created a `cleanup_cases_with_sections.py` script that manually deletes document sections before deleting the document. This was used to clean up cases 238 and 239 that had orphaned sections.

2. **Direct relationship testing**: We tested the fixed relationship by:
   - Creating test documents with sections
   - Deleting the documents
   - Verifying no orphaned sections remained

3. **Orphaned sections check**: We ran a database-wide check for any orphaned sections (sections where the parent document no longer exists), which confirmed that no orphaned sections exist.

## Verification
The test confirmed that the cascade delete relationship is now working correctly. When Document 240 was deleted with 3 associated sections, all sections were automatically deleted as well, with no constraint violations or orphaned records.

## Impact
This fix ensures that:

1. The "Delete Case" functionality works correctly without database errors
2. No orphaned section data remains in the database when documents are deleted
3. Database integrity is maintained with proper parent-child relationship cascading
