# Anthropic SDK 0.51.0 Update - LLM Integration Fix

**Date:** May 20, 2025  
**Author:** Claude AI  
**Issue:** Concept extraction error with Anthropic SDK v0.51.0

## Problem Description

After updating the proethica-intermediate ontology, the guidelines concept extraction process began failing with error:

```
2025-05-20 00:03:31,691 - app.routes.worlds - ERROR - Guideline processing error: Concept Extraction Error - Error extracting concepts: LLM client not available
```

This error was occurring due to two main issues:

1. Incompatibility with the latest Anthropic SDK (v0.51.0) which changed its response structure format
2. Environment configuration issues with Python path and dependency conflicts

## Changes Made

We implemented the following fixes:

### 1. Dependency Consolidation

- Created a consolidated requirements file with explicit version pinning for Anthropic SDK
- Set Anthropic SDK to version 0.51.0 (exact pinning to avoid future breaking changes)
- Consolidated all requirements into a single file for easier maintenance

### 2. Environment Configuration

- Created `setup_environment.sh` script that:
  - Disables Conda environment to avoid conflicts
  - Sets proper Python path to user site-packages
  - Installs dependencies with proper versioning
  - Verifies installations work correctly

### 3. Code Updates to Support v0.51.0

- Updated `app/utils/llm_utils.py`:
  - Added version detection for Anthropic SDK
  - Improved client initialization with robust error handling
  - Added support for different API versions (v1, v1.5, v2)

- Updated `app/services/guideline_analysis_service.py`:
  - Prioritized the use of `messages.create` API for Anthropic v0.51.0
  - Added proper handling for the new content structure (list format)
  - Removed deprecated `response_format` parameter
  - Fixed variable name consistency issues

### 4. Testing

- Created `test_anthropic_integration.py` test script to verify:
  - SDK installation and version
  - API key availability
  - Client initialization
  - Successful API calls with the new response format
  - Integration with the application's LLM utilities

## How to Apply the Fix

1. First, revert to a clean state:
   ```bash
   git reset --hard HEAD && git clean -fd
   ```

2. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   ./setup_environment.sh
   ```

3. Verify the installation works:
   ```bash
   python test_anthropic_integration.py
   ```

4. Test guideline concept extraction:
   ```bash
   python -m app.test.test_live_guideline_extraction
   ```

## Technical Details

### Response Format Changes

With Anthropic SDK v0.51.0, the response format changed significantly:

**Old Format (pre-v0.5x.x):**
```python
response = client.completion(...)
text = response.completion
```

**New Format (v0.5x.x):**
```python
response = client.messages.create(...)
# Content is now a list of content blocks
text = response.content[0].text
```

### Key Code Changes

The most important change was in how we handle the response content structure:

```python
# Handle the response content structure
if hasattr(response, 'content'):
    if isinstance(response.content, list) and len(response.content) > 0:
        response_text = response.content[0].text
    else:
        response_text = str(response.content)
else:
    logger.warning("Unexpected response format - no content attribute")
    response_text = str(response)
```

This allows the code to be backward compatible with older SDK versions while properly handling the new format.
