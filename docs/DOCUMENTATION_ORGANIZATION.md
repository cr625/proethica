# Documentation Organization Summary

## Overview
All markdown documentation files from the root directory have been organized into appropriate subdirectories under `/docs/`, leaving only README.md and CLAUDE.md in the root as they are essential project files.

## Organization Structure

### Files Remaining in Root
- **README.md** - Main project readme (standard practice)
- **CLAUDE.md** - AI assistant instructions (actively used)

### Files Moved to `/docs/`
- **HOW_TO_START.md** - Core getting started guide (moved to docs root)

### Files Moved to `/docs/ui/`
- **UI_REFRESH_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - UI implementation details
- **UI_REFRESH_PLAN.md** - UI planning and restructuring

### Files Moved to `/docs/project-management/`
- **CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md** - Deployment cleanup and infrastructure organization

### Files Moved to `/docs/reference/`
- **TYPE_MANAGEMENT_OPTIMIZATION_2025_06_09.md** - Ethics concept type management
- **TYPE_MANAGEMENT_REVIEW_GUIDE.md** - Guide for reviewing ethical concept types

## Benefits
1. **Cleaner root directory** - Only essential files remain
2. **Logical organization** - Documentation grouped by topic
3. **Easy navigation** - Clear directory structure
4. **Separation of concerns** - Generic vs domain-specific docs clearly separated
5. **Future-proof** - Easy to add new documentation categories

## Notes
- Type management docs were moved to reference as they contain ethics-specific concepts
- UI docs got their own directory as UI is a major component
- Project management directory created for maintenance and planning docs
- HOW_TO_START.md placed in docs root as it's the primary getting started guide
