# Enhanced Ontology LLM Integration via MCP

## Overview

This document outlines how the ProEthica system integrates ontologies with Language Learning Models (LLMs) using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This integration allows LLMs to access structured knowledge from ontologies, reason with ontological constraints, and provide contextually accurate responses.

## Architecture

The integration follows a three-layer architecture:

1. **Ontology Layer**: Stores and manages structured domain knowledge
2. **MCP Communication Layer**: Provides protocol-based access to ontology data
3. **LLM Integration Layer**: Connects LLMs with ontology data through context injection

## Key Components

### 1. Enhanced MCP Client

The `EnhancedMCPClient` class provides a high-level interface for LLMs to interact with ontologies:

- **Entity Access**: Retrieve entities of different types (roles, capabilities, conditions, etc.)
- **Relationship Navigation**: Traverse relationships between entities
- **Constraint Checking**: Validate logical constraints defined in the ontology
- **Guideline Access**: Retrieve guidelines associated with the ontology
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Provides mock data when ontology access fails

### 2. Context Providers

The ontology context provider extracts relevant information from ontologies and formats it for LLM consumption:

- **Entity Context**: Information about entities related to a query
- **Guideline Context**: Guidelines that may apply to the current scenario
- **Relationship Context**: How entities relate to each other
- **Structural Context**: The hierarchy and organization of the ontology

### 3. MCP Protocol Handlers

These components handle the JSON-RPC 2.0 communication between the application and MCP servers:

- **HTTP Ontology MCP Server**: Exposes ontology data via HTTP endpoints
- **Load From DB**: Retrieves ontology data from the database
- **Tool Definitions**: Defines the available tools for LLMs to access ontology data

## Integration Methods

### Method 1: Context Injection

This method injects ontology data into the LLM's context window before generating a response:

1. The user submits a query about an ontology
2. The system retrieves relevant entities, relationships, and guidelines
3. This data is formatted and added to the LLM's context
4. The LLM generates a response using this enriched context

```
User Query -> Retrieve Ontology Data -> Format Context -> LLM Generation -> Response
```

### Method 2: Tool-Based Access

This method allows the LLM to make direct calls to ontology-related tools:

1. The LLM is configured with access to ontology tools via MCP
2. When the LLM needs ontology information, it calls the appropriate tool
3. The tool returns structured data about the ontology
4. The LLM incorporates this data into its reasoning

```
LLM -> Tool Call -> MCP Server -> Ontology Query -> Structured Data -> LLM
```

## Implementation Details

### EnhancedMCPClient Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `get_entities()` | Retrieves entities of a specific type from an ontology |
| `get_entity_relationships()` | Retrieves relationships for a specific entity |
| `navigate_entity_hierarchy()` | Navigates up/down the class hierarchy |
| `query_ontology()` | Executes a SPARQL query against the ontology |
| `check_constraint()` | Checks if an entity satisfies specified constraints |
| `search_entities()` | Searches for entities by keywords or patterns |
| `get_ontology_guidelines()` | Retrieves guidelines from an ontology |

### Data Formatting

Ontology data is formatted for LLMs using structured templates:

```
# [Entity Name]
[Entity Description]

Types: [Entity Types]
Parent Classes: [Parent Classes]

Properties:
- [Property Name]: [Property Value]
- ...

Capabilities:
- [Capability Name]: [Capability Description]
- ...
```

### Fallback Mechanisms

The system includes robust fallback mechanisms to handle failures:

1. **Mock Data Fallback**: Returns predefined mock data when ontology access fails
2. **Error Reporting**: Clear error messages are included in the context
3. **Graceful Degradation**: System continues to function with limited ontology data

## Example Workflow

1. A user asks: "What roles are defined in the engineering ontology?"
2. The system:
   - Identifies the query is about roles in the engineering ontology
   - Retrieves role entities using `get_entities(ontology_source, 'roles')`
   - Formats the role data as structured context
   - Passes the context to the LLM
3. The LLM responses with a description of engineering roles based on the ontology data

## Benefits of MCP-Based Integration

1. **Structured Knowledge Access**: LLMs can access precise, structured ontology data
2. **Consistency Enforcement**: Ontology constraints guide LLM responses
3. **Domain Grounding**: Responses are grounded in domain-specific knowledge
4. **Reasoning Transparency**: The source of information in responses is traceable
5. **Extensibility**: New ontologies can be added without changing the LLM interface

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **Context Window Limits**: Large ontologies may exceed LLM context windows
2. **Performance Overhead**: Multiple ontology queries can increase response time
3. **Error Handling**: LLMs may not handle ontology access errors gracefully
4. **Query Interpretation**: Mapping natural language to ontology queries requires optimization

## Future Enhancements

1. **Semantic Reasoning**: Integrate a semantic reasoner for complex constraint checking
2. **Query Optimization**: Improve retrieval to minimize context window usage
3. **Fine-tuning Integration**: Use ontology data to fine-tune LLMs for specific domains
4. **Cross-Ontology Mapping**: Enable reasoning across multiple ontologies
5. **User-Specific Context**: Tailor ontology access based on user roles and permissions
