# LLM Evaluation in Extensional Definition Approach

## Experimental Design

This document outlines the experimental design for evaluating large language models (LLMs) using our extensional definition approach to engineering ethics. The experiment tests whether LLMs, when trained on extensionally defined principles, can reach similar conclusions to human experts when presented with new engineering ethics cases.

### Research Questions

1. Can LLMs trained on extensionally defined principles accurately identify relevant principles in new cases?
2. Do LLMs resolve principle conflicts in a manner consistent with expert consensus?
3. Does the extensional definition approach improve LLM performance compared to abstract principle descriptions?
4. What operationalization techniques are most effectively modeled by LLMs?

### Methodology

#### 1. Dataset Preparation

**Training Set:**
- 25 NSPE ethics cases with:
  - Principle instantiations
  - Principle conflicts and resolutions
  - Operationalization techniques identified
  - Expert consensus decisions

**Test Set:**
- 5 NSPE ethics cases (not in training set) with the same annotations
- 3 novel engineering ethics scenarios created for this experiment

#### 2. Leave-One-Out Validation Design

For each test case:
1. **Case Preprocessing:**
   - Extract case facts, entities, and relationships
   - Format as a scenario without revealing the expert decision
   - Create ontology-aligned representations

2. **LLM Testing:**
   - Present the LLM with case facts and relevant contextual information
   - Ask the LLM to:
     - Identify applicable principles
     - Spot potential conflicts between principles
     - Propose a resolution based on extensionally defined principles
     - Justify its decision using operationalization techniques

3. **Comparative Analysis:**
   - Compare LLM outputs with expert consensus decisions
   - Evaluate the alignment of principle identification
   - Assess conflict resolution strategies
   - Analyze the use of operationalization techniques

#### 3. Experimental Conditions

1. **Baseline Condition:** 
   - LLM with abstract principle definitions only
   - No access to previous case examples

2. **Extensional Definition Condition:**
   - LLM with access to extensionally defined principles
   - Previous case examples demonstrating principle application

3. **Ontology-Enhanced Condition:**
   - LLM with extensionally defined principles
   - Ontology-aligned representations of principles and cases
   - Structured knowledge of relationships between ethical concepts

### Evaluation Metrics

1. **Principle Identification Accuracy:**
   - Precision: Correctly identified principles / Total identified principles
   - Recall: Correctly identified principles / Actually applicable principles
   - F1 score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

2. **Conflict Resolution Alignment:**
   - Agreement rate with expert consensus
   - Similarity of reasoning patterns
   - Appropriate use of operationalization techniques

3. **Decision Justification Quality:**
   - Richness of justification (number of relevant facts cited)
   - Use of relevant precedent cases
   - Alignment with professional engineering standards

### Expected Outcomes

1. LLMs trained with extensional definitions will outperform baseline models in principle identification.
2. Ontology-enhanced models will show the highest performance in conflict resolution.
3. LLMs will demonstrate some operationalization techniques more effectively than others.
4. The greatest challenges will be in complex conflict cases where multiple principles apply with similar strength.

  "principles": [
    {
      "principle_uri": "http://ethics.org/principles/confidentiality",
      "instantiation": "Engineer discovers structural defects during inspection",
      "facts": ["building has structural defects", "engineer signed confidentiality agreement"],
      "strength": 0.7
    },

      "principle_uri": "http://ethics.org/principles/public_safety",
      "instantiation": "Structural defects pose risk to public safety",
      "facts": ["building has structural defects", "public safety at risk"],
      "strength": 0.9

      "description": "Resolving conflict between confidentiality and public safety by prioritizing safety"
    }
  ],
  "expert_decision": {
    "conclusion": "Engineer should report defects to authorities",
    "justification": "The engineer's obligation to protect public safety overrides confidentiality agreement",

### Data Collection and Analysis Plan

1. **Case Preparation Phase** (Completed):
   - Process and annotate NSPE cases from our database
   - Create structured representations with principle instantiations
   - Add expert consensus decisions and reasoning

2. **LLM Evaluation Phase** (In Progress):
   - Design prompt templates for consistent testing
   - Select appropriate LLM models and parameters
   - Run experiments across baseline and experimental conditions
   - Collect LLM outputs in structured format

3. **Analysis Phase** (Planned):
   - Calculate accuracy metrics for principle identification
   - Evaluate conflict resolution alignment with experts
   - Assess decision justification quality
   - Compare performance across experimental conditions
   - Identify patterns in LLM strengths and weaknesses

### Technical Implementation

The experiment will be implemented using:

   - Statistical analysis of performance across conditions

## Conclusion

This experimental design provides a framework for rigorously evaluating LLM performance in engineering ethics case analysis using McLaren's extensional definition approach. The results will contribute to our understanding of how LLMs can be effectively leveraged for ethical reasoning in engineering contexts and the value of extensional definitions compared to abstract principles alone.
