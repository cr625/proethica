# LLM-Ontology Integration Architecture in ProEthica

## Overview

ProEthica integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with formal ontologies to enhance ethical decision-making in engineering contexts. This architecture enables LLMs to access structured knowledge, reason with ontological constraints, and provide contextually accurate responses grounded in professional ethics standards.

## Core Architecture

### Three-Layer Design

```
┌─────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────┐
│  Ontology Layer │◄────►│ MCP Layer       │◄────►│ LLM Layer       │
└─────────────────┘      └─────────────────┘      └─────────────────┘
```

1. **Ontology Layer**
   - Database-backed RDF storage (Turtle/TTL format)
   - Version control with audit trail
   - Entity type hierarchy (roles, resources, conditions, actions, events, capabilities)
   - Temporal extensions for time-based reasoning
   - Based on Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) ISO standard

2. **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Layer**
   - JSON-RPC 2.0 API for ontology access
   - Enhanced ontology tools for entity retrieval and navigation
   - Context generation and formatting for LLM consumption
   - Fallback mechanisms with mock data
   - Performance optimization through caching

3. **LLM Integration Layer**
   - Context injection into LLM prompts
   - Tool-based direct ontology access
   - Specialized prompting for ethical reasoning
   - Constraint enforcement from ontological rules
   - Temporal reasoning capabilities

## Integration Methods

### Method 1: Context Injection
```
User Query → Retrieve Ontology Data → Format Context → LLM Generation → Response
```

### Method 2: Tool-Based Access
```
LLM → Tool Call → MCP Server → Ontology Query → Structured Data → LLM
```

## Key Components

### Enhanced MCP Client
- `get_entities()`: Retrieve entities of specific types
- `get_entity_relationships()`: Explore entity connections
- `navigate_entity_hierarchy()`: Traverse class/subclass relationships
- `query_ontology()`: Execute SPARQL queries
- `check_constraint()`: Validate ontological constraints
- `search_entities()`: Find entities by keywords
- `get_ontology_guidelines()`: Extract ethical guidelines

### Context Formatting
```
# [Entity Name]
[Entity Description]

Types: [Entity Types]
Parent Classes: [Parent Classes]

Properties:
- [Property Name]: [Property Value]

Capabilities:
- [Capability Name]: [Description]
```

## Benefits
- Structured knowledge access beyond training data
- Consistency enforcement through ontological constraints
- Domain grounding in professional standards
- Reasoning transparency with traceable sources
- Temporal reasoning for sequential events
- Multi-perspective ethical analysis

## Technical Advantages
- Extensibility for new ontologies
- BFO-based interoperability
- Full auditability of knowledge used
- Performance optimization
- Resilient fallback mechanisms
- Clear separation of concerns
