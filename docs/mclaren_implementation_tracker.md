## Next Steps

1. Enhance matching accuracy by incorporating ML techniques for better principle detection
2. Implement visualization of extensional definitions in the UI
3. Add cross-case analysis to identify patterns across multiple cases
4. Incorporate user feedback to improve the quality of analyses
5. Develop an interactive interface for exploring the McLaren analysis results
