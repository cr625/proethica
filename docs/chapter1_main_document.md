# Chapter 1: Introduction

## 1.1 Setting: Defining the Scope

### 1.1.1 Key Definitions and Scope

This research focuses on the evaluation of professional decisions as conducted by ethics committees and review boards, which assess whether actions taken by professionals align with established professional standards. Professional roles carry distinctive moral obligations that general moral theories do not capture with precision (Oakley and Cocking, 2001; Wendel, 2024). These obligations arise from specialized knowledge and training that create a higher standard of care than that expected of the general public.

The legal system recognizes this through the professional negligence standard, codified in the Restatement (Third) of Torts, which requires professionals to exercise "the skill and knowledge normally possessed by members of that profession or trade in good standing" (American Law Institute, 2010, § 299A). Courts evaluate conduct against role-specific standards established through expert testimony and professional codes, not universal benchmarks. An engineer's decisions are judged against engineering standards, a physician's against medical standards, and a lawyer's against legal norms (Oakley and Cocking, 2001; Davis, 1991).

Professional associations apply similar logic through their ethics review processes, evaluating conduct against standards developed over centuries of practice (Frankel, 1989; Davis, 1991). These standards represent a form of societal consensus about professional obligations, refined through countless cases and evolving alongside technological and social changes (Kong et al., 2020). Professional standards adapt to address emerging technologies and shifting societal values, and this adaptation creates increasing complexity for ethics committees in their evaluative work.

Ethics committees must continuously reevaluate precedents in light of new technologies, updated guidelines, and changing societal expectations (Hallamaa and Kalliokoski, 2022; Taddeo et al., 2024). The manual nature of this process makes it difficult to systematically reassess past decisions when standards change or to ensure consistent application of evolving principles across cases (McLaren, 2003; Ashley and McLaren, 1995). This creates a need for systematic methods that can help professional communities maintain the relevance and consistency of their ethical standards while preserving the accumulated wisdom embedded in established precedents and institutional knowledge.

This research presents ProEthica, a computational system that applies role-based ethics to professional domains by drawing on their established guidelines and case precedents. Following Segun's (2021) distinction, we employ the term computational ethics as the practical implementation of ethical decision-making in AI systems, moving beyond theoretical discussions to actual programming and validation. This computational ethics approach differs from the theoretical focus of machine ethics (Cervantes et al., 2016) by emphasizing the actual embedding of ethics into functional systems through code, algorithms, and systematic testing (Segun, 2021).

ProEthica addresses the challenges of professional ethical analysis by combining four methods: (1) ontologies encoding professional codes, standards, and case histories as structured knowledge graphs; (2) large language models for natural language understanding and concept extraction; (3) case-based reasoning for precedent retrieval and application; and (4) evaluative AI that provides traceable scenario evaluation. The system analyzes scenarios to identify roles, obligations, and relevant precedents, then generates arguments for and against each decision option with justification trails linked to these sources. Rather than rendering decisions, ProEthica presents this structured analysis to inform human deliberation, supporting the precedent-based analysis that characterizes both legal negligence doctrine and professional ethics review.

### 1.1.2 Professional Decision Context

This evaluative context in professional domains differs fundamentally from general AI ethics research that depends on datasets of moral intuitions, crowdsourced ethical judgments, or focuses on abstract philosophical dilemmas. General approaches to AI ethics attempt to capture normative ethics through aggregated human judgments about right and wrong, while professional ethics follows prescribed analytical paths established through accumulated precedent and institutional practice (Tolmeijer et al., 2021). ProEthica operates on these same formal structures that committees employ and implements the analytical processes used when evaluating professional conduct against codes of ethics established by professional societies and regulatory bodies (Davis, 1991; Frankel, 1989; Kong et al., 2020).

This professional standards approach grounds ethical reasoning in the application of specific professional codes and precedents, transforming what might otherwise remain theoretical concepts into concrete foundations for analysis. Unlike legal proceedings that determine negligence through liability standards, ethics committees focus on whether conduct aligns with professional values and ideals, often addressing situations where legal compliance alone proves insufficient for professional integrity (Frankel, 1989). In practice, ethics committees evaluate professional conduct, they do not consult general moral intuitions or philosophical theories, nor do they limit themselves to questions of legal liability. Instead, they apply specific provisions from their profession's codes of ethics. They compare the situation to established precedents from review board cases and evaluate whether the professional met the standard of care expected within their field. This pattern extends across all regulated professions. Engineers reference codes from professional societies when evaluating structural failures or design decisions, physicians consult medical board precedents and professional guidelines, and lawyers apply bar association rulings and ethics opinions. Each profession follows structured analytical pathways defined by their respective codes and accumulated case law.

These characteristics of professional ethics codes reveal why their computational implementation requires more than rule encoding. Professional codes function as living documents that guide judgment through principles and precedents rather than dictate outcomes through rigid rules. Their deliberate flexibility allows practitioners to navigate complex situations where principles may conflict or where novel circumstances demand creative application of established guidelines. For AI systems to support professional decision-making effectively, they must preserve this interpretive flexibility while providing transparent reasoning that professionals can evaluate against their own expertise and contextual understanding. This demands computational approaches that can represent the structured yet adaptable nature of professional judgment itself.

### 1.1.3 Analytical Scope

The ProEthica system described above operates within specific analytical boundaries. Although the computational framework offers advantages over manual review, it faces inherent limitations. Professional ethics often involves contextual subtleties and implicit knowledge that resist formal encoding. The system cannot capture the tacit understanding that experienced practitioners bring to novel situations, exercise the professional judgment that emerges from years of practice, or navigate the political and interpersonal dynamics that influence real committee deliberations. The case-based reasoning component can incorporate outcomes that reflect intuitive professional judgment through precedent decisions, but the system cannot generate such intuitive leaps independently or understand why experienced practitioners made certain choices beyond their documented rationales.

The research explicitly focuses on professional decision evaluation rather than autonomous decision-making. ProEthica conducts analysis to expose analytical pathways rather than performing moral reasoning. The system identifies decision points and relevant contextual factors in professional scenarios, then systematically examines how different choices align with professional standards and precedents. This multistage process reveals alternative reasonable decision paths and enables viewing situations from multiple professional perspectives. The system shows whether actions are supported by professional context and precedent and provides plausible analysis of how decisions might be evaluated without making moral judgments or replacing human moral agency.

This focus on analysis rather than judgment aligns with theoretical foundations in professional ethics that recognize the contextual nature of professional obligations. Oakley and Cocking's (2001) foundational work in role morality demonstrates that behaviors must be evaluated within specific professional settings rather than through universal moral principles. Their analysis explains why the same action might be obligatory for one professional role yet prohibited for another. This role-based perspective reinforces the distinction between ethical analysis and moral reasoning. While moral reasoning systems attempt to determine right from wrong, ProEthica focuses on exposing the arguments and evidence relevant to professional actions, allowing human decision-makers to retain moral agency and accountability.

## 1.2 Motivation and Background

### 1.2.1 Role Ethics for Professional Evaluation

The distinctive obligations of professional roles create practical challenges for ethics committees tasked with evaluation of ethical questions. These role-specific obligations emerge from the specialized knowledge, societal trust, and institutional authority that professional positions entail. The consistent application of these role-based standards proves difficult in practice. Ethics committees must apply these standards consistently across cases, yet the accumulated precedents and evolving codes that guide their decisions resist systematic application (Frankel, 1989; Davis, 1991). Each profession maintains its own evaluative frameworks, with engineering boards referencing engineering standards, medical boards applying clinical guidelines, and legal committees consulting bar association rulings.

Expert reviewers are scarce, and participation diverts them from primary professional responsibilities. Many technical specialists lack formal ethics training, yet their domain expertise proves essential for evaluating professional conduct (Hallamaa and Kalliokoski, 2022). The volume of cases requiring review continues to grow while committee resources remain constrained. These limitations create delays in ethical review processes and risk inconsistent application of professional standards across similar cases. The manual nature of precedent research and case analysis further compounds these challenges, as reviewers must navigate thousands of accumulated cases to identify relevant precedents and patterns.

### 1.2.2 Computational Ethics and Professional Standards

Early attempts at computational ethics relied primarily on rule-based moral decision procedures, which proved inadequate for handling contextual variability (McLaren, 2006; Wallach and Allen, 2009). These efforts revealed the fundamental challenges of encoding ethical principles into rigid logical structures. Previous work explored computational support for ethical analysis through various methodologies including case-based reasoning (CBR) (McLaren, 2003; Ashley and McLaren, 1995), principle learning (Anderson and Anderson, 2018; Abel et al., 2016), and formal logic (Govindarajulu and Bringsjord, 2017; Benzmüller et al., 2020).

These systems demonstrated both the potential and limitations of computational ethical analysis in professional contexts. Notably, McLaren's SIROCCO system pioneered the computational analysis of engineering ethics cases by demonstrating how abstract principles become operationalized through their application in specific NSPE Board of Ethical Review cases, establishing foundational methods for extensional principle definition that inform current approaches (McLaren, 2003). SIROCCO validated the viability of computational approaches to professional ethical analysis within established frameworks using the same case corpus employed in our evaluation.

Domain-specific systems such as MedEthEx implemented Beauchamp and Childress' principles of biomedical ethics through inductive logic programming (Anderson, 2006; Anderson, 2007), while GenEth provided broader ethical dilemma analysis but lacked the domain-specific grounding needed for professional contexts (Anderson and Anderson, 2018). These systems established that professional ethics applications require domain-specific knowledge representation rather than general moral reasoning frameworks.

Most recent approaches have focused on abstract moral reasoning rather than the specific obligations and standards that govern professional practice (Jiang et al., 2025). Recent developments in natural language processing and knowledge representation, however, enable hybrid approaches that combine symbolic reasoning with natural language understanding and case-based analysis. LLM-based systems provide the natural language understanding and orchestration capabilities needed to coordinate diverse ethical components. These systems can orchestrate interactions with formal ontologies, professional codes, and case precedents (Yao et al., 2023), and allow system designers to move beyond earlier approaches that simply prompted LLMs with ethical context to generate moral judgments. This orchestration capability allows them to sequence actions from natural language prompts while maintaining connections to structured knowledge sources (Kampelopoulos et al., 2025). The distinction proves important for professional ethics applications: rather than relying on LLMs to generate ethical judgments from training data patterns, these systems use LLMs as orchestrators that coordinate between formal knowledge representations, precedent databases, and validation mechanisms.

### 1.2.3 Need for Automated Professional Ethical Analysis

Professional decisions frequently involve multiple competing obligations that point toward different outcomes. Determining which obligation should prevail requires expert judgment and sensitivity to case specifics (Beauchamp and Childress, 2019; Anderson, 2006; Anderson, 2007), particularly in complex domains where conflicting priorities, uncertainty, and time pressure mean experts often disagree on the correct action. Each profession faces distinct challenges in applying ethical standards. Engineers must evaluate acceptable risk levels that ordinary citizens would not be qualified to judge, while navigating complex tradeoffs between safety, cost, and performance. Physicians balance patient autonomy against beneficence when patients refuse recommended treatment (Anderson, 2006; Anderson and Anderson, 2011). Lawyers navigate conflicts between client confidentiality and duties to the court (Wendel, 2024). Accountants weigh transparency obligations against corporate privacy concerns (Kong et al., 2020). These role-specific duties require professional expertise to evaluate properly, yet the volume and complexity of cases requiring ethical review continues to grow across all professional domains.

Manual processes present several limitations. These include difficulty accessing and cross-referencing relevant precedents from accumulated case histories, time-intensive coordination requirements for gathering committee input and conducting thorough reviews, challenges in maintaining consistent interpretations of professional codes across different reviewers and time periods, limited capacity to handle case volumes given volunteer time constraints, and lack of structured methods for capturing and transferring institutional knowledge between committee generations.

## 1.3 GAP

### 1.3.1 The Methodological Gap

While these efforts have advanced the field significantly, they face recurring challenges that prevent effective computational support for professional ethical analysis. The gap between abstract principles and concrete application proves particularly problematic. As McLaren (2003) demonstrated through analysis of NSPE Board cases, professional codes articulate high-level principles like "hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public," but these contain open-textured terms that resist precise definition (Hallamaa and Kalliokoski, 2022; Taddeo et al., 2024). McLaren's SIROCCO system showed how the Board extensionally defines such principles through their application in specific cases.

The Board's precedent cases illustrate this interpretive challenge. McLaren's analysis of Case 89-7 shows how an engineer discovering structural deficiencies must interpret whether public safety obligations override client confidentiality. The Board operationalizes the abstract "paramount" principle by examining specific facts: immediate threat presence, remediation availability, and harm scope. The concept of "imminence" proves particularly context-dependent—Case 00-5's bridge with immediate collapse risk demands urgent action, while Case 07-10's barn allows measured remediation, demonstrating how similar principles apply differently based on threat immediacy.

McLaren identified nine operationalization techniques the Board uses to bridge this gap, including principle instantiation (linking principles to critical facts), conflicting principles resolution (determining which principle takes precedence), and case instantiation (drawing analogies to past cases). Current systems struggle to navigate this interpretive complexity because they lack mechanisms to connect abstract principles to situational specifics through the extensional definitions that emerge from accumulated precedent patterns.

Beyond the interpretive challenges McLaren identified, the maintenance of professional context presents additional computational obstacles. Professional decisions occur within networks of relationships, institutional structures, and temporal sequences that shape ethical obligations. A physician's duty to a patient differs when acting as primary care provider versus consulting specialist versus emergency responder. An accountant's obligations shift between audit engagement, tax preparation, and management advisory roles. Current computational approaches often treat ethical decisions as isolated events rather than recognizing how professional context determines applicable standards. This decontextualization leads to analyses that miss critical factors professionals routinely consider.

Integration with existing workflows remains problematic across domains. Ethics committees operate through established procedures involving case documentation, precedent research, deliberation protocols, and decision documentation. Current AI tools function as external systems requiring separate interfaces, data formats, and analytical processes. This separation creates friction that limits adoption. Committee members must translate between their standard practices and system requirements, often duplicating effort and introducing potential for error. The lack of integration also prevents systems from learning from committee decisions or incorporating institutional knowledge accumulated through years of practice.

When humans act in professional capacities, their alignment with ethical principles, social norms, and legal regulations is typically evaluated against established guidelines and standards of their professions. One approach to assessing AI alignment involves analyzing whether an AI system operates in accordance with human normative standards. Given this analogy, professional standards and guidelines developed for human decision-makers can be systematically applied to evaluate AI systems when they perform tasks traditionally associated with human professional roles (Rauch et al., 2025). This standards-based approach provides a concrete framework for validating whether AI decisions meet the same competence criteria expected of human professionals in domains such as medical triage. The alignment of an AI system can therefore be judged, at least in part, by its adherence to these established professional standards. However, current AI tools lack the mechanisms to effectively implement and validate this alignment.

Professional ethics often draws on case-based analysis that applies precedent to current circumstances using the principle of consistent treatment (Ashley and McLaren, 1995; Guarini, 2006). Yet the volume and complexity of accumulated precedents creates practical barriers. Engineering ethics alone includes thousands of Board of Ethical Review cases spanning decades, each potentially relevant to current decisions. Manual precedent research becomes increasingly difficult as case volumes grow. Reviewers may miss relevant precedents or fail to recognize patterns across multiple cases. The challenge intensifies when standards evolve, requiring reinterpretation of historical precedents in light of updated codes or societal expectations. Although computational ethics research has advanced in implementing ethical decision-making in AI systems, it remains largely disconnected from the codified standards and analytical practices used by professionals in regulated fields. This gap arises partially from the difficulty of translating high-level principles into enforceable constraints and functional tools (Dennis et al., 2016; Scheutz and Malle, 2014), but also from the failure to recognize that professional ethics operates through structured analytical processes rather than general moral intuitions.

### 1.3.2 Unutilized Professional Resources

Current AI tools face critical limitations in professional contexts. They cannot enforce domain-specific standards without structured knowledge, lack support for precedent-based analogical reasoning despite partial CBR solutions (Ashley and McLaren, 1995; McLaren, 2003), and provide limited validation of ethical constraints. LLMs specifically struggle with three issues. They show inability to enforce professional codes during analysis despite referencing them in prompts (Liu, 2024; Carrell, 2023), lack of genuine analogical reasoning even with retrieval augmentation (Webb, 2023; Gao, 2024), and absence of bidirectional integration between constraint mechanisms and validation (Batarseh, 2021; Busuioc, 2021).

### 1.3.3 Role-Based Ethics Requirements

Effective computational ethics for professional domains requires adherence to several design principles. Anderson and Anderson (2018) argue that systems must ground their analysis in community consensus and institutional authority rather than abstract moral theories, recognizing that professional contexts provide clearer normative guidance than philosophical abstractions.

This aligns with Tolmeijer et al.'s (2021) finding that successful implementations combine domain-specific ethics accepted by field experts with representation capabilities. Berreby et al. (2017) emphasize displacing the burden of moral reasoning from programmer to program through modular frameworks that can represent professional ethical analysis processes.

## 1.4 Research Questions

### 1.4.1 RQ1: Methodology for Professional Reasoning

**RQ1: What methodology for building AI systems could deliver the professional analysis needed?**

Professional ethics presents unique computational challenges. Abstract principles must be interpreted through precedent, obligations vary by role and context, and multiple competing duties often apply simultaneously. Existing AI approaches have not adequately addressed these requirements. This research investigates whether a methodology combining formal ontologies, large language models, case-based reasoning, and structured validation can provide the systematic analysis that professional ethics committees require.

To answer this question, the research develops and evaluates a formal knowledge representation D = (R, P, O, S, Rs, A, E, Ca, Cs) that captures the essential components of professional ethical analysis. This methodology addresses three critical gaps. First, it enables the extensional definition of abstract principles through accumulated precedents, following McLaren's (2003) foundational approach. Second, it integrates role-specific obligations that emerge from professional context rather than universal moral principles. Third, it maintains traceable connections between analysis outputs and authoritative sources. Chapter 3 details how each component of this formal framework is implemented through synthesis of established computational ethics approaches, demonstrating how the methodology bridges the gap between high-level professional codes and concrete ethical analysis.

### 1.4.2 RQ2: Validation of Professional Reasoning

**RQ2: How can we validate the analysis for a subset of use cases and present the trace of each argument as an interpretable unit?**

Validating computational ethical analysis presents distinct challenges from validating general AI systems. Professional ethics validation requires demonstrating alignment with established professional judgment patterns while maintaining transparency in the reasoning process. This research develops a two-part validation approach.

First, the research establishes validation metrics specific to professional ethics applications including constraint compliance with professional codes, relevance accuracy in precedent retrieval, and coverage of professional framework components. These metrics are tested through a holdout protocol using NSPE Board of Ethical Review cases, where each test case is analyzed using only other cases as precedents, then compared against actual Board decisions. Second, the research implements interpretability mechanisms through structured justification chains that connect each analytical step to specific provisions in codes, relevant precedents, or ontological relationships. Chapter 4 presents the complete validation protocol, including how SHACL constraints verify structural integrity, how precedent matching validates contextual relevance, and how the system generates traceable argument paths that professionals can verify against their domain expertise.

## 1.5 Methodology Overview

### 1.5.1 ProEthica System Architecture

The ProEthica system emerges from synthesis of computational ethics literature, integrating established theoretical foundations into a cohesive architectural design. This literature-driven methodology draws from three seminal works that provide complementary perspectives on professional ethical analysis: McLaren's (2003) extensional principle definition through precedent cases, Berreby et al.'s (2017) modular architecture for ethical analysis systems, and Tolmeijer et al.'s (2021) requirements for implementing ethical analysis agents. The literature review in Chapter 2 identifies patterns across diverse approaches to computational ethics, extracting design principles that inform each component of the system.

This synthesis-based methodology uses theoretical foundations from the literature to directly shape system architecture. Rather than proposing novel ethical theories or analytical mechanisms, ProEthica integrates proven concepts from established research into a unified system specifically tailored for professional ethics applications. These foundational works provide both the theoretical justification for each component and the implementation patterns that guide their integration.

Creating a domain-specific ethical analysis system with ProEthica requires three core components derived from the literature synthesis. These include formal ontologies that encode professional standards as structured knowledge graphs, professional guidelines that define obligations and principles, and case precedents that provide concrete examples of ethical analysis.

ProEthica employs a formal knowledge representation structure where each professional domain D is defined as a tuple D = (R, P, O, S, Rs, A, E, Ca, Cs). Chapter 2 provides comprehensive theoretical foundations for each component through synthesis of computational ethics literature. This representation captures

- **R (roles):** Professional positions with associated duties and responsibilities that define authorized actions and required competencies (Oakley and Cocking, 2001; Kong et al., 2020)
- **P (principles):** Abstract ethical guidelines from professional codes that achieve meaning through extensional definition via precedent cases (McLaren, 2003; Anderson and Anderson, 2018)
- **O (obligations):** Concrete moral requirements to act or refrain from acting, derived from principles and contextualized through role-specific duties (Dennis et al., 2016; Scheutz and Malle, 2014)
- **S (states):** Situational contexts and environmental conditions that activate different ethical considerations (Almpani et al., 2023; Rao et al., 2023)
- **Rs (resources):** Precedents, codes, and knowledge sources that provide extensional definition of principles and support reasoning (McLaren, 2003; Hallamaa and Kalliokoski, 2022)
- **A (actions):** Professional decisions and interventions categorized by permissibility and evaluated for consequences (Bonnemains et al., 2018; Dawson, 1994)
- **E (events):** Temporal occurrences that trigger ethical considerations and state transitions (Berreby et al., 2017; Sarmiento et al., 2023)
- **Ca (capabilities):** Agent abilities and competencies required for professional ethical analysis (Epstein, 2002; Cervantes et al., 2020)
- **Cs (constraints):** Boundaries and validation requirements derived from professional standards and regulatory frameworks (Ganascia, 2007; Dennis and del Olmo, 2021)

This representation builds on the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) (Arp, Smith, and Spear, 2015) as an upper-level framework, providing logical structure for professional concepts while maintaining domain-specific extensions.

### 1.5.2 Implementation Components

ProEthica processes scenarios derived from Board of Ethical Review cases through four integrated components. These include LLM-based extraction of key elements, description logic validation, precedent identification, and structured analysis generation. The system employs established ontological foundations including BFO and IAO, with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) enabling integration between ontological knowledge and language model capabilities. Chapter 3 provides complete technical implementation details including multi-metric relevance calculation, SHACL constraint validation, and the semantic router architecture.

The system's architecture enables handling of professional ethical complexity. Abstract principles achieve concrete meaning through precedent-based extensional definition, following McLaren's (2003) foundational approach. Role-specific obligations emerge from the interaction between principles and professional contexts. Event sequences trigger appropriate ethical considerations based on situational factors. Resources are dynamically filtered and prioritized based on contextual relevance. Actions are evaluated against multiple permissibility categories considering both deontological and consequentialist factors. Capabilities determine which professional responsibilities agents can fulfill. Constraints from multiple sources are validated and explained through formal verification methods.

## 1.6 Empirical Evaluation Overview

While RQ2 addresses the validation methodology for ensuring professional alignment and interpretability, this section describes the specific empirical evaluation protocol for testing ProEthica with actual cases and professional practitioners.

### 1.6.1 Case-Based Evaluation Protocol

System validation follows a holdout protocol using NSPE Board of Ethical Review cases, building on established case-based evaluation methodologies (McLaren, 2003; Ashley and McLaren, 1995). In this approach, each test case is excluded from the precedent case base while the system analyzes the scenario using only the remaining cases and professional codes to generate an ethical assessment. This validation approach extends McLaren's (2003) SIROCCO system methodology, which demonstrated the viability of holdout validation for professional ethics cases, while incorporating insights from case-based reasoning for moral particularism (Guarini, 2006) where ethical relevance varies by context.

Recent literature reveals a notable gap in validation methodologies for case-based reasoning systems in computational ethics (2020-2025), with no specific papers detailing empirical validation protocols such as holdout validation or cross-validation for CBR systems in this domain. This absence reflects a fundamental shift toward integrating CBR as a component within larger AI frameworks rather than as standalone systems. While this gap presents challenges, it also highlights the distinctive contribution of our validation approach.

Rather than evaluating whether the system produces "correct" ethical conclusions, which assumes a single right answer where reasonable experts may disagree, our evaluation focuses on the quality and completeness of the analytical process itself. Professional ethics committees do not seek singular correct answers but rather thorough analysis that exposes relevant principles, precedents, and obligations. Accordingly, our validation assesses whether ProEthica generates plausible analytical pathways that professionals can examine, verify, and use to inform their judgment. The system succeeds when it produces traceable arguments connecting professional codes to specific obligations through relevant precedents, regardless of whether its conclusion matches a predetermined outcome. This process-oriented evaluation aligns with recent frameworks for evaluating machine learning explanations, which emphasize assessing the quality of reasoning traces and justification chains rather than merely outcome accuracy (Zhou et al., 2021).

While engineering ethics serves as the primary domain for initial validation based on our submitted work, the research extends to medical triage as a second domain to demonstrate the methodology's generalizability. Medical triage presents distinct professional challenges including time-critical decision-making under resource constraints, standardized protocols from emergency medicine guidelines, and well-documented precedent cases from disaster response scenarios. The medical domain evaluation will apply the same formal framework D = (R, P, O, S, Rs, A, E, Ca, Cs) using the Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) guidelines as described in Rauch et al. (2025), case precedents from combat medical scenarios, and professional guidelines from military medical ethics sources. This second domain validates that the methodology can adapt to different professional contexts while maintaining analytical rigor.

Evaluation of professional ethics systems requires methodologies that assess alignment with established professional frameworks rather than general moral reasoning capabilities (Anderson and Anderson, 2018; Abel et al., 2016). The system's evaluation focuses on constraint compliance with professional code provisions (NSPE for engineering, TCCC for medical triage), relevance accuracy in precedent retrieval, and professional framework coverage. These evaluation criteria build on established approaches including Ethical Turing Tests that assess whether systems achieve expert-level performance (Anderson and Anderson, 2018) and validation through expert-labeled cases (Abel et al., 2016). The ontological validation occurs at multiple levels: SHACL constraints verify structural integrity of the knowledge representation, BFO alignment ensures logical consistency across component relationships, and precedent matching validates that retrieved cases share relevant professional contexts. These metrics directly address the requirements for professional ethics applications where consistency with established case patterns proves essential (Wiratunga, 2024; Sourati, 2023; Ashley and McLaren, 1995).

### 1.6.2 Professional Practitioner Evaluation

Beyond the case-based evaluation protocol, assessment with professional practitioners provides critical validation of the system's practical utility and alignment with expert judgment.

Evaluation with professional practitioners will assess the system's alignment with expert judgment and its utility in supporting ethical review processes. The evaluation protocol includes comparison of system outputs with Board of Ethical Review decisions and assessment of the quality and relevance of retrieved precedents. This evaluation will be conducted under Drexel University IRB oversight, with the protocol likely qualifying for exempt status under Category 2 (educational tests, surveys, interviews) as it involves professional experts evaluating system outputs rather than vulnerable populations or sensitive personal information. The IRB protocol will ensure appropriate informed consent procedures for participating professionals while maintaining focus on system performance evaluation rather than individual participant responses.

## 1.7 Expected Contributions

### 1.7.1 Systematic Methodology for Professional Ethics

This work describes a system for role-based analysis that integrates large language models, ontologies, and case-based reasoning to support ethical analysis in practice. ProEthica operationalizes professional codes, standards, and precedents by translating them into a computational framework that can analyze ethical scenarios.

The formal knowledge representation D = (R, P, O, S, Rs, A, E, Ca, Cs) provides coverage of professional ethical analysis components, addressing gaps identified in prior computational ethics approaches. ProEthica's extensional principle definition through precedent cases, building on McLaren's (2003) foundational work, enables concrete application of abstract ethical guidelines in professional contexts.

### 1.7.2 Demonstrated Implementation

An implementation in engineering ethics is presented as the primary use case demonstrating ProEthica's capabilities. The modular design supports extension to other professions with established codes and case records. The system demonstrates how computational methods can support professional ethical analysis without replacing human judgment.

The implementation shows practical application of all nine formal components. Roles structure professional responsibilities, principles gain meaning through precedent application, obligations emerge from contextualized interpretation, states determine applicable ethical considerations, resources provide authoritative support, actions are evaluated for permissibility and consequences, events trigger temporal reasoning, capabilities define competence boundaries, and constraints ensure regulatory compliance.

## 1.8 Chapter Summary

ProEthica demonstrates how computational methods can support professional ethical analysis while preserving human judgment as the final arbiter of ethical decisions. The system integrates ontologies, large language models, case-based reasoning, and evaluative AI through the formal framework D = (R, P, O, S, Rs, A, E, Ca, Cs) to provide structured analysis grounded in professional codes and precedents while maintaining traceability through complete justification chains. Initial validation in engineering ethics, the system's primary use case, shows promise for enhancing consistency and thoroughness in ethical review processes.

The subsequent chapters will elaborate on the theoretical foundations (Chapter 2), present the methodology for RQ1 (Chapter 3), detail the validation approach for RQ2 (Chapter 4), enumerate the expected contributions (Chapter 5), and outline next steps and timeline (Chapter 6). Chapter 2 provides literature review and theoretical foundations for all nine components of the formal framework, establishing the scholarly context for the ProEthica system through synthesis of work from McLaren (2003), Berreby et al. (2017), Tolmeijer et al. (2021), and extensive additional sources from computational ethics, professional ethics theory, and AI systems research.
