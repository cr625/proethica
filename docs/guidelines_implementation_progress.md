# Guidelines Implementation Progress

This document tracks the implementation progress of the guidelines concept extraction feature.

## Completed Features

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Guideline document upload and storage
- ✅ Guideline content extraction
- ✅ Concept extraction using Claude
- ✅ User interface for reviewing extracted concepts
- ✅ Triple generation for selected concepts
- ✅ Saving concepts to the ontology database

### Database Models
- ✅ Guidelines table
- ✅ Entity_triples table with guideline relation
- ✅ Foreign key relationships

### User Interface
- ✅ Guidelines management UI
- ✅ Concept extraction button
- ✅ Concept review page
- ✅ Concept selection for saving

### Integration
- ✅ MCP server integration with GuidelineAnalysisModule
- ✅ Flask routes for guideline operations
- ✅ Background processing for document extraction

## In Progress

### Enhanced User Experience
- 🔄 Visualization of guideline concepts
- 🔄 Improving concept review UI with better formatting
- 🔄 Error handling improvements

### Integration Improvements
- 🔄 Better connection between guidelines and other world entities
- 🔄 Optimizing database queries for performance

## Pending

### Native Claude Tool Use
- ⏳ Converting prompts to use Claude's native tool use
- ⏳ Dynamic ontology querying during concept extraction
- ⏳ Tool handlers for Claude's tool calls

### Advanced Features
- ⏳ Concept versioning
- ⏳ Batch processing
- ⏳ Ontology impact analysis
- ⏳ Integration with simulation system

## Issues and Challenges

### Known Issues
1. **Debugging Challenges**:
   - Breakpoints in MCP server code don't reliably trigger due to asyncio event loop interactions
   - Solution: Added enhanced logging and mock response capability for testing

2. **Database Design**:
   - Need to ensure all required columns exist in entity_triples table
   - Solution: Created ensure_schema.py script to verify and add missing columns

3. **Form Submission Size**:
   - Large sets of concepts may exceed form submission limits
   - Solution: Split data into smaller chunks or use AJAX submission

### Technical Debt
1. **Error Handling**:
   - Need more comprehensive error handling throughout the guideline flow
   - Add more specific error messages and recovery paths

2. **Testing Coverage**:
   - Need automated tests for guideline concept extraction
   - Need integration tests for the full guideline flow

3. **Documentation**:
   - API documentation for GuidelineAnalysisModule
   - User documentation for the guideline feature

## Next Action Items

1. Implement native Claude tool use for concept extraction
2. Improve the concept review UI with interactive elements
3. Add more comprehensive error handling
4. Create automated tests for the guideline flow
5. Enhance ontology alignment for extracted concepts
