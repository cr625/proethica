# Features Implemented

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the features implemented in the AI Ethical DM application.

## Document Structure Features

The document structure features enhance the application's ability to understand and represent the semantic structure of case documents:

### Ontology-Based Document Structure

- **Document Structure Classes**: Extended the ProEthica ontology with classes for document structure representation (e.g., DocumentSection, Facts, Discussion, Conclusion)
- **Document Structure Properties**: Added semantic properties to connect document elements with concepts from the ethics domain
- **Triple Generation**: Implemented automatic generation of RDF triples to represent document structure

### Section Embeddings

- **Vector Embeddings**: Generate vector embeddings for each document section using the embedding service
- **pgvector Storage**: Store section embeddings using PostgreSQL's pgvector extension for efficient similarity searches
- **Section Similarity**: Implemented functionality to find similar sections across different documents

### Guideline Section Integration

- **Guideline-Section Associations**: Associate ethical guidelines with specific document sections
- **Relationship Classification**: Identify the type of relationship between sections and guidelines (e.g., applies_to, references)
- **Confidence Scoring**: Calculate confidence scores for guideline associations

## User Interface Features

The user interface has been enhanced to provide access to the document structure features:

### Document Structure Visualization

- **Structure View**: Added a dedicated view for document structure visualization
- **Section Display**: Show document sections with their type and content
- **Embedding Status**: Visual indicator for sections with embeddings

### Section Embedding UI

- **Generate Embeddings**: Button to generate embeddings for document sections
- **Search Similar Sections**: Interface for searching similar sections across documents
- **Section Comparison**: View for comparing sections from different documents

### Guideline Association UI

- **Generate Associations**: Button to generate guideline associations for document sections
- **Association Display**: Table view of guidelines associated with each section
- **Confidence Indicators**: Visual representation of confidence scores for associations

## Technical Infrastructure

The technical infrastructure has been enhanced to support these features:

### Database Extensions

- **pgvector**: Integrated PostgreSQL's pgvector extension for vector storage and similarity search
- **Document Section Model**: Created dedicated model for section storage with vector capabilities
- **Metadata Schema**: Enhanced document metadata schema to include structure information

### Services

- **SectionEmbeddingService**: Service to manage the generation and storage of section embeddings
- **GuidelineSectionService**: Service to manage the association of guidelines with document sections
- **Pipeline Integration**: Integrated document structure annotation into the case processing pipeline

### Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Created unit tests for section embedding and guideline association services
- **Migration Scripts**: Developed utilities to migrate existing cases to the new structure
- **Validation Tools**: Added tools to validate document structure, embeddings, and guideline associations

## Document Structure Enhancement Implementation Notes

The document structure enhancements follow these key principles:

1. **BFO Compliance**: Document structure modeling follows Basic Formal Ontology principles, representing document parts as generically dependent continuants
2. **Backward Compatibility**: All enhancements maintain compatibility with existing documents
3. **Performance Optimization**: Vector storage using pgvector for efficient similarity search
4. **Semantic Richness**: Structure connects to ethical principles and guidelines for advanced reasoning

## Future Development Areas

The following areas are planned for future development:

1. **Advanced UI Visualizations**: Visual representations of document structure and relationships
2. **Section-Based Search Refinement**: Enhanced UI for section-specific searches
3. **User Documentation**: Comprehensive help materials for the new features
4. **API Extensions**: REST endpoints for programmatic access to document structure and embeddings
