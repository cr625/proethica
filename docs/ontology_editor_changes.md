Ontology Editor Integration Changes

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to the ontology editor integration in the A-Proxy project, focusing on the interface improvements, database integration, and fixing of URL handling issues.

## Recent Changes (2025-04-24)

### Database-Only Storage

1. **Elimination of File-Based Storage**
   - Removed file-based storage fallback mechanisms completely
   - Modified file storage utilities to disable file reads/writes
   - Added logging warnings for any attempted file access
   - Preserved directory structure with empty placeholder files for backward compatibility
   - Created backup of original ontology files in `ontologies_removed` directory

2. **API Route Fixes**
   - Fixed URL prefix in `ontology_editor/api/routes.py` from `/ontology-editor/api` to just `/api`
   - Eliminated duplicated URL paths that were causing 404 errors
   - Resolved BuildError in world detail page related to API endpoint naming
   - Added proper parameter name consistency across all routes

3. **Migration Scripts**
   - Created scripts to verify ontologies are properly stored in database
   - Implemented tool to safely move ontology files to backup location
   - Added database-only mode script to update all necessary components

### UI Improvements

1. **Button Label Consistency**
   - Fixed inconsistent button labels in the world detail page
   - Changed the previously generic "Edit Ontology" button in the World Entities card to "Edit Entities" to better describe its purpose
   - Maintained the "Edit Ontology" label for the button next to the Ontology Source field
   - Each button now clearly indicates its specific purpose based on location and function

2. **URL Parameter Handling**
   - Standardized URL parameter handling for the ontology editor
   - Added support for the `view` parameter to specify whether the user is:
     - Editing the full ontology (`view=full`)
     - Editing only entities (`view=entities`)
     - Editing a specific entity (`view=entity` with an additional `uri` parameter)
   - Fixed stripping of `.ttl` extensions from ontology sources for consistent URL handling

### API and Backend Changes

1. **Database Models**
   - Added `Ontology` model to store ontology metadata and content
   - Added `OntologyVersion` model to maintain version history
   - Updated `World` model with a foreign key reference to ontologies

2. **API Route Improvements**
   - All API routes now use the database exclusively
   - Added proper error handling for cases where ontologies aren't found in the database
   - Fixed URL pattern handling to support ontology sources with and without `.ttl` extension
   - Updated route functions to consistently use parameter names across endpoints

3. **Error Handling**
   - Improved error logging for better troubleshooting
   - Added more descriptive error messages for common issues
   - Implemented status checks for ontology availability

## Usage Instructions

### Accessing the Ontology Editor

The ontology editor can now be accessed in several ways:

1. **From the World Detail Page**:
   - "Edit Ontology" button next to Ontology Source - opens the full ontology editor
   - "Edit Entities" button in the World Entities card - opens the entity-focused editor view

2. **Direct URL Access**:
   - `/ontology-editor?ontology_id=<id>&view=full` - full ontology editing
   - `/ontology-editor?ontology_id=<id>&view=entities` - entity-focused editing
   - `/ontology-editor?ontology_id=<id>&view=entity&uri=<entity_uri>` - specific entity editing

### URL Parameters

- `ontology_id`: The database ID of the ontology
- `view`: The editor view type (`full`, `entities`, or `entity`)
- `uri`: Required when `view=entity`, specifies which entity to edit

## Known Issues

- Very large ontologies might experience performance issues in the editor
- Entity relationship visualization is limited in the current implementation
- Authentication required for API access, but not always enforced in UI

## Future Enhancements

- Implement a visual ontology editor with relationship diagram support
- Add collaborative editing features for ontologies
- Provide version comparison and rollback capabilities
- Enhance search and filter capabilities for large ontologies
- Improve database indexing for better performance with large ontologies
