# Archived Planning Documents Reference

This document provides a summary of planning and progress tracking documents that have been completed or superseded. These documents are preserved for historical reference but no longer reflect current implementation.

## Section-Triple Association Plans

### 1. section_triple_association_plan.md
**Created**: Early May 2025  
**Status**: Completed  
**Summary**: Original plan for associating RDF triples with document sections using embedding-based similarity. Proposed architecture with embedding service, similarity calculation, and storage in junction table. Most components were implemented as planned.

### 2. section_embedding_and_triple_association_analysis.md
**Created**: May 2025  
**Status**: Theoretical analysis, partially implemented  
**Summary**: Deep technical analysis of how section embeddings could work with triple associations. Explored vector similarity approaches and semantic matching strategies. Served as theoretical foundation for implementation.

### 3. updated_section_triple_association_plan.md
**Created**: May 22, 2025  
**Status**: Completed  
**Summary**: Revised approach to load triples directly from TTL files rather than database. Introduced the ontology triple loader component and refined the association strategy. This became the actual implementation approach.

### 4. llm_section_triple_association_plan.md
**Created**: May 2025  
**Status**: Completed (all checkboxes marked done)  
**Summary**: Plan to enhance associations using LLM (Claude) for semantic understanding. Proposed hybrid approach combining embeddings with LLM analysis. Successfully implemented and improved association coverage from ~15% to ~45%.

### 5. section_triple_association_progress.md
**Created**: May 2025  
**Status**: Progress tracking document  
**Summary**: Tracked implementation progress including completed tasks, technical decisions, and issues encountered. Documents the evolution from embedding-only to hybrid approach.

## Case Processing Pipeline Plans

### case_processing_pipeline_plan.md
**Created**: May 2025  
**Status**: Phases 1-2 completed, Phase 3 pending  
**Summary**: Multi-phase plan for modular case processing pipeline:
- Phase 1: URL retrieval (✓ Complete)
- Phase 2: NSPE extraction (✓ Complete)  
- Phase 3: Entity extraction (Pending, replaced by section associations)
- Phase 4: Triple generation (Partially implemented via associations)

## Key Takeaways from Planning Documents

1. **Evolution of Approach**: Started with embedding-only similarity, evolved to hybrid embedding+LLM approach
2. **Architecture Decisions**: Chose to load from TTL files directly rather than database storage
3. **Performance Trade-offs**: Accepted slower LLM processing for better semantic coverage
4. **Integration Success**: Section associations successfully integrated into prediction service

## Using Historical Documentation

These planning documents are valuable for:
- Understanding design decisions and trade-offs
- Tracking feature evolution
- Onboarding new developers
- Planning similar features

However, for current implementation details, refer to:
- `README.md` - Case processing pipeline overview
- `SECTION_TRIPLE_ASSOCIATION.md` - Current association implementation
- Source code comments - Most up-to-date implementation details
