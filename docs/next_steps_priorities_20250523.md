# Next Steps Priorities - May 23, 2025

## 🎯 Current Status: Core System FULLY OPERATIONAL

✅ **Experiment Workflow**: Complete end-to-end functionality  
✅ **HTML Display**: Clean text in web interface  
✅ **Template Rendering**: All variables working correctly  
✅ **Database**: Constraints and relationships resolved

## 🔥 IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Next 1-2 Sessions)

### 1. **Evaluation Framework Implementation** 🚀
**Why**: Templates reference evaluation features that aren't fully implemented
**Impact**: Essential for research validation and user studies

**Tasks**:
- Implement `evaluate_prediction()` route referenced in templates
- Create evaluation criteria (accuracy, ethical reasoning quality, etc.)
- Build comparison framework for original vs predicted conclusions
- Add evaluation storage in database

### 2. **Multi-Case Testing & Validation** 📊
**Why**: System tested primarily with Case 252 - need broader validation
**Impact**: Ensures robustness across different case types

**Tasks**:
- Test formal experiment workflow with 3-5 different cases
- Validate ontology integration across case types
- Check for edge cases or content structure variations
- Document any case-specific issues

### 3. **Performance & Scale Testing** ⚡
**Why**: Current system optimized for single case - needs scale validation
**Impact**: Prepares for larger research studies

**Tasks**:
- Test batch processing of multiple cases in single experiment
- Optimize database queries for large result sets
- Test system performance with 10+ cases
- Implement pagination properly for large experiments

## 🎯 MEDIUM-TERM PRIORITIES (Next Week)

### 4. **Enhanced Documentation** 📚
**Why**: Technical documentation needs updates after all fixes
**Impact**: Enables other researchers/developers to use system

**Tasks**:
- Update technical reference with latest architecture
- Document the enhanced clean text approach 
- Create user guide for experiment setup and evaluation
- Add troubleshooting guide

### 5. **Advanced Evaluation Features** 🔬
**Why**: Research requires sophisticated evaluation metrics
**Impact**: Enables publication-quality research

**Tasks**:
- Implement similarity scoring between original/predicted conclusions
- Add ethical reasoning quality metrics
- Create statistical analysis of prediction accuracy
- Build export functionality for research data

### 6. **User Interface Enhancements** 🎨
**Why**: Current interface is functional but could be more intuitive
**Impact**: Better user experience for researchers

**Tasks**:
- Add progress indicators for long-running experiments
- Implement real-time experiment status updates
- Create dashboard with experiment analytics
- Add case preview functionality

## 🚀 LONG-TERM PRIORITIES (Future Sessions)

### 7. **Research Integration** 🎓
- Integration with external research tools
- Export to academic citation formats
- Statistical analysis integration (R/Python)
- Publication-ready visualizations

### 8. **System Hardening** 🛡️
- Error handling improvements
- Logging and monitoring enhancements
- Performance monitoring
- Backup and recovery procedures

### 9. **Advanced Features** ⭐
- A/B testing framework for different AI models
- Collaborative evaluation (multiple reviewers)
- Machine learning model comparison
- Advanced ontology reasoning

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE ACTION

**Priority #1: Evaluation Framework**

Start with implementing the evaluation system since:
1. Templates already reference it (quick implementation)
2. Essential for validating prediction quality 
3. Enables immediate research use
4. Builds on existing solid foundation

**Suggested starting point**: Implement the `evaluate_prediction()` route and basic comparison interface between original and predicted conclusions.

## 📈 Success Metrics

- **Evaluation System**: Researchers can score prediction quality
- **Multi-Case Validation**: 5+ cases tested successfully  
- **Performance**: Handle 10+ case experiments smoothly
- **Documentation**: Complete user guide available
- **Research Ready**: System ready for academic publication use

**Current Progress**: ✅ Infrastructure Complete → 🎯 Research Features Next
