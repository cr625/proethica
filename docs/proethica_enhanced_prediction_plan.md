# ProEthica Enhanced Prediction Service Implementation Plan

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for the ProEthica enhanced prediction service, which leverages ontology constraints and bidirectional validation to improve ethical reasoning and decision prediction.

## Core Components

### 1. Ontology Entity Retrieval
- Retrieve ontology triples associated with document sections
- Extract relevant engineering ethics concepts from the triple associations
- Group and rank entities by relevance to the case

### 2. Ontology-Constrained FIRAC Prompting
- Create enhanced prompts using the FIRAC (Facts, Issues, Rules, Application, Conclusion) framework
- Incorporate relevant ontology entities into each FIRAC section
- Structure prompts to enforce logical reasoning steps

### 3. Bidirectional Validation
- Forward validation: Ensure predictions follow from ontology constraints
- Backward validation: Verify that conclusions can be derived from ontology-based principles
- Implement consistency checking between sections

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Enhanced Triple Retrieval for Cases
- Use `SectionTripleAssociationService` to query associated triples for document sections
- Filter triples by relevance to engineering ethics
- Group triples by concept category (principles, rules, precedents)
- Calculate relevance scores for each triple

### Step 2: Multi-Metric Relevance Scoring
- Implement semantic similarity scoring for concepts
- Add frequency-based weighting of concepts
- Develop context-sensitive filtering of concepts
- Create consolidated relevance metric

### Step 3: Ontology-Constrained Prompt Construction
- Develop FIRAC template with placeholders for ontology concepts
- Implement dynamic context window management for LLM prompts
- Create structure for bidirectional validation checks
- Integrate professional framework references

### Step 4: Enhanced Prediction Generation
- Implement `generate_proethica_prediction` method in `PredictionService`
- Create helper methods for ontology integration
- Add traceability for concept usage in reasoning
- Implement bidirectional validation process

## Technical Components

### Ontology Integration

```python
def get_section_ontology_entities(self, document_id: int, sections: Dict[str, str]) -> Dict[str, List[Dict]]:
    """
    Get ontology entities associated with document sections.
    
    Returns:
        Dictionary mapping section types to associated ontology entities
    """
    # Implementation details...
```

### FIRAC Prompt Construction

```python
def _construct_proethica_prompt(self, document: Document, 
                              sections: Dict[str, str],
                              ontology_entities: Dict[str, List[Dict]],
                              similar_cases: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> str:
    """
    Construct an ontology-enhanced FIRAC prompt.
    
    Returns:
        Enhanced prompt string
    """
    # Implementation details...
```

### Bidirectional Validation

```python
def _validate_prediction(self, prediction: str, 
                       ontology_entities: Dict[str, List[Dict]]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Validate prediction against ontology constraints.
    
    Returns:
        Validation results and confidence metrics
    """
    # Implementation details...
```

## Integration with Experiment Interface

The enhanced prediction service will integrate with the experiment interface through:

1. Adding the enhanced prediction method to the prediction service
2. Updating the experiment controller to use both baseline and enhanced methods
3. Displaying results side-by-side for evaluation
4. Tracking ontology concepts used in each prediction

## Evaluation Metrics

To measure the effectiveness of the ontology-enhanced approach:

1. Reasoning Quality: Logical coherence and completeness
2. Persuasiveness: Subjective assessment of argument strength
3. Accuracy: Alignment with NSPE conclusions
4. Support Quality: Evidence and principle grounding
5. Ontology Utilization: Effective use of engineering ethics concepts

## Implementation Timeline

1. Enhanced Triple Retrieval (1-2 days)
2. Multi-Metric Relevance Scoring (1-2 days)
3. FIRAC Prompt Construction (2-3 days)
4. Bidirectional Validation (2-3 days)
5. Integration and Testing (1-2 days)

Total estimated time: 7-12 days
