# LLM-Enhanced Triple Generation Roadmap

## Current Implementation (Phase 1)

The current triple generation implementation successfully creates basic RDF triples from guideline concepts with the following characteristics:

- **Basic Type Handling**: Each concept gets appropriate `rdf:type` triples based on concept category
- **Standard Properties**: Creates triples for labels, descriptions, IDs, and categories
- **Related Concepts**: Generates `relatedTo` relationships between concepts
- **Domain-Specific Relations**: Automatically creates domain-specific relationships (e.g., principles guide actions)
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Supports both JSON and Turtle output formats
- **Deterministic Output**: Produces consistent, predictable triples

## Phase 2: LLM-Enhanced Triple Generation

The next phase will enhance the triple generation capability using the LLM to create more semantically meaningful relationships between concepts and detect implicit connections that aren't explicitly stated.

### Implementation Plan

1. **Design LLM Prompt Template**
   - Create a specialized prompt template for triple generation
   - Include ontology structure information to guide the LLM
   - Provide examples of desired triple output format
   - Include specific instructions for relationship detection

2. **Implement LLM-Based Generator**
   - Create a new method `_generate_llm_enhanced_triples` in the `GuidelineAnalysisModule` class
   - Add configuration options to enable/disable LLM enhancement
   - Implement proper error handling with fallback to basic generation

3. **Merge Basic and LLM-Generated Triples**
   - Start with the basic triple generation as a foundation
   - Add LLM-generated semantic triples
   - Remove duplicate or contradictory triples
   - Ensure consistent formatting and labeling

4. **Ontology Integration**
   - Enhance LLM prompts with specific ontology entity information
   - Guide the LLM to create relationships that align with the ontology structure
   - Validate LLM-generated triples against ontology constraints

5. **Quality Control Mechanisms**
   - Implement validation checks for LLM-generated triples
   - Create filtering rules to remove low-confidence triples
   - Add user configuration options for generation quality thresholds

### LLM Prompt Draft

```
You are an expert in RDF triple generation and knowledge representation. Given the concepts below, generate meaningful semantic triples that capture the relationships between these concepts and the broader engineering ethics domain.

For each relationship you identify, create a subject-predicate-object triple in the following format:
{
  "subject": "URI",
  "predicate": "URI",
  "object": "URI or literal value",
  "subject_label": "Human-readable label",
  "predicate_label": "Human-readable relationship",
  "object_label": "Human-readable target",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0 score,
  "explanation": "Brief explanation of relationship"
}

Consider the following relationship types:
- Hierarchical (isA, partOf, subClassOf)
- Process (causes, enables, prevents)
- Responsibility (responsibleFor, accountableTo)
- Ethical (conflictsWith, supportsValue, requiresVirtue)
- Normative (obligated, permitted, prohibited)

Input concepts:
[CONCEPTS HERE]

Available ontology entities:
[ENTITIES HERE]

Remember to:
1. Focus on meaningful, non-trivial relationships
2. Provide a confidence score for each triple (0.0-1.0)
3. Return only valid JSON
4. Include a brief explanation for non-obvious relationships
```

### Technical Requirements

1. **API Enhancements**
   - Add a `use_llm_enhancement` parameter to the `generate_concept_triples` tool
   - Modify the response structure to include confidence scores for LLM-generated triples
   - Add a `max_relationships` parameter to control output size

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - Implement caching for similar concept sets
   - Consider batching similar concepts to reduce LLM API calls
   - Set appropriate timeouts for LLM-enhanced generation

3. **Deployment Changes**
   - Ensure proper environment variable configuration for LLM access
   - Document increased token usage for budgeting
   - Create flag to enable/disable feature at deployment level

## Testing and Validation Plan

1. **Comparative Analysis**
   - Test same concepts with and without LLM enhancement
   - Compare triple count, relationship types, and semantic richness
   - Create visualization of relationship networks

2. **Quality Assessment**
   - Create benchmark concept sets with known relationships
   - Measure precision/recall of relationship detection
   - Evaluate readability and utility of generated triples

3. **User Evaluation**
   - Gather feedback from domain experts on triple quality
   - Test in real application scenarios
   - Evaluate impact on downstream reasoning tasks

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Design LLM prompt and testing framework
2. **Week 2**: Implement LLM-enhanced generation and basic integration
3. **Week 3**: Add filtering, quality control, and ontology alignment
4. **Week 4**: Testing, benchmarking, and documentation

## Future Directions (Phase 3)

1. **Multi-Ontology Alignment**: Map concepts across multiple reference ontologies
2. **Interactive Triple Refinement**: Allow users to refine LLM-generated triples
3. **Temporal and Causal Reasoning**: Add support for time-based and causal relationships
4. **Contradiction Detection**: Identify potentially conflicting ethical principles

This roadmap provides a structured approach to enhancing the triple generation capability with LLM technology while maintaining the reliability of the current implementation.
