# Ontology Agent Improvements

## Implementation Details

The ontology agent interface has been enhanced to ensure that when a world is selected, the default ontology associated with that world is automatically loaded. This ensures a more intuitive and coherent user experience by:

1. **Automatic Ontology Detection**: When a user selects a world (e.g., Engineering World), the system automatically identifies and loads the associated ontology (e.g., engineering-ethics).

2. **Context Preservation**: The world-ontology relationship is maintained throughout the session, ensuring that all queries and responses are contextually appropriate to the selected world.

3. **Simplified UI Flow**: The interface has been streamlined to prevent selection conflicts that could cause world-context reset issues.

## Technical Implementation

The implementation involves two key components:

### Backend Changes

The system now includes an API endpoint to retrieve the ontology information for a selected world:

- **API Endpoint**: `/agent/ontology/api/world-ontology` provides the ontology details for a given world ID
- **Ontology Resolution**: The system resolves ontologies either via direct `ontology_id` references or through the `ontology_source` field
- **Error Handling**: Appropriate error handling for cases where worlds have no associated ontology

### Frontend Improvements

The UI has been updated to:

- **Conditionally Display Options**: Ontology selection is only directly available when no world is selected
- **Show Associated Ontology**: When a world is selected, its associated ontology is displayed
- **Prevent Selection Conflicts**: Eliminate the ability to select incompatible combinations that could reset context

## Environment-Aware Configuration

The system now runs with an environment-aware configuration that automatically adapts to development or production environments:

1. **Configuration Structure**:
   - `config/environment.py`: Main environment detector
   - `config/environments/development.py` and `config/environments/production.py`: Environment-specific settings

2. **Enhanced MCP Server Management**:
   - Environment-specific path configuration for logs and lock files
   - Automatic port detection and conflict resolution
   - Improved logging and error reporting

3. **Automatic Environment Detection**:
   - Based on the `ENVIRONMENT` variable in `.env` file or environment variables
   - Defaults to 'development' when not specified

## Testing and Verification

The improvements have been tested and verified to work correctly in the development environment:

1. **MCP Server**: Responds correctly to API requests at http://localhost:5001
2. **Web Application**: Successfully serves content at http://localhost:3333
3. **Ontology Agent**: Functions properly at http://localhost:3333/agent/ontology/
4. **Database Connectivity**: Successfully queries and returns data for worlds, ontologies, and other entities

## Usage

To use the improved ontology agent:

1. Visit http://localhost:3333/agent/ontology/
2. Select a world from the dropdown (e.g., "Engineering Ethics World")
3. Observe that the associated ontology is automatically loaded
4. Select entity categories to explore from the "Ontology Entities" dropdown
5. Chat with the agent about the selected entities

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements include:

1. Adding a visual indicator in the UI to show which ontology is currently active
2. Implementing caching for frequently accessed ontology entities
3. Adding support for cross-ontology queries when relevant to multiple worlds
4. Enhancing the visualization of entity relationships
