# REALM Development Roadmap

## Overview

REALM (Resource for Engineering and Advanced Learning in Materials) is a new application integrating the Materials Science and Engineering Ontology (MSEO). The goal is to provide a specialized interface for materials science research and education while leveraging the agent-based architecture established in ProEthica.

## Architecture

### Shared Components
- **agent_module**: Core agent interaction capabilities
- **mcp servers**: Ontology integration and LLM communication
- **database infrastructure**: Shared PostgreSQL container with separate schemas

### REALM-Specific Components
- **UI/UX**: Materials science focused interfaces
- **MSEO Integration**: Specialized materials science ontology tools
- **Material Models**: Database models for materials, properties, and relationships
- **Service Layer**: Material analysis and recommendation services

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- ✅ Basic project structure
- ✅ Shared database infrastructure
- ✅ MSEO ontology integration framework
- ⬜ Initial UI templates
- ⬜ Material models and relationships

### Phase 2: Core Functionality
- ⬜ MSEO ontology MCP server implementation
- ⬜ Material property querying
- ⬜ Basic material visualization
- ⬜ Relationship mapping between materials and properties
- ⬜ Chat interface for materials queries

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- ⬜ Material recommendation engine
- ⬜ Property prediction using ML models
- ⬜ Material substitution analysis
- ⬜ Interactive material structure visualization
- ⬜ Comparison tools for material properties

### Phase 4: Integration and Expansion
- ⬜ Literature integration (papers, patents)
- ⬜ External database connections
- ⬜ Material design tools
- ⬜ Collaborative features
- ⬜ API for external applications

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema
The materials database will include:
- Materials (compositions, structures)
- Properties (mechanical, electrical, thermal, etc.)
- Processing methods
- Applications and use cases
- Relationships between materials and properties

### MSEO MCP Server
The specialized MCP server will:
- Import MSEO ontology from matportal.org
- Parse and index the ontology for quick querying
- Expose API endpoints for material property retrieval
- Support reasoning over material relationships
- Provide natural language interfaces to technical material data

### UI Components
- Material browser
- Property visualization
- Relationship graphs
- Search interface
- Chat interface for material queries

## Integration with ProEthica

REALM will maintain compatibility with ProEthica through:
- Shared agent module codebase
- Common MCP server architecture
- Unified database infrastructure
- Compatible authentication systems

## Next Steps

1. Complete MSEO ontology import and parsing
2. Finalize database models for materials and properties
3. Implement basic UI for material browsing
4. Develop MSEO-specific MCP tools
5. Create initial material property visualization
