## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Improve Core Services

```python
# Enhance MCPJsonRpcClient with retry logic
class MCPJsonRpcClient:
    def __init__(self, url="http://localhost:5001", max_retries=3):
        self.url = url
        self.jsonrpc_endpoint = f"{url}/jsonrpc"
        self.max_retries = max_retries
        self.session = requests.Session()
        self.session.timeout = (5, 60)  # Longer timeout for LLM operations
        
    def call_tool_with_retry(self, name, arguments):
        """Call a tool with retry logic."""
        for attempt in range(self.max_retries):
            try:
                response = self.call_tool(name, arguments)
                if "error" not in response:
                    return response
                
                # Wait before retry (exponential backoff)
                time.sleep(2 ** attempt)
            except Exception as e:
                logger.exception(f"Attempt {attempt+1} failed: {str(e)}")
                time.sleep(2 ** attempt)
                
        # Final attempt without catching exceptions
        return self.call_tool(name, arguments)
```

### Phase 2: Implement Server Status Monitoring

```html
<!-- Add to base.html -->
<div class="server-status">
  <span id="mcp-status-indicator" class="status-indicator"></span>
  <span id="mcp-status-text">MCP Server: Checking...</span>
</div>

<script>
  function checkServerStatus() {
    fetch('/api/mcp/status')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => {
        const indicator = document.getElementById('mcp-status-indicator');
        const text = document.getElementById('mcp-status-text');
        
        if (data.online) {
          indicator.className = 'status-indicator online';
          text.textContent = `MCP Server: Online`;
        } else {
          indicator.className = 'status-indicator offline';
          text.textContent = `MCP Server: Offline`;
        }
      })
      .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error checking server status:', error);
      });
  }
  
  // Check status on page load and every 30 seconds
  checkServerStatus();
  setInterval(checkServerStatus, 30000);
</script>
```

### Phase 3: Implement Caching System

```python
# Add Redis caching to GuidelineAnalysisService
def extract_concepts_with_cache(self, content: str, ontology_source: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Extract concepts with caching for performance."""
    # Generate cache key from content hash and ontology source
    cache_key = f"concepts:{hashlib.md5(content.encode()).hexdigest()}:{ontology_source or 'default'}"
    
    # Try to get from cache first
    cached_result = redis_client.get(cache_key)
    if cached_result:
        try:
            return json.loads(cached_result)
        except:
            logger.warning("Could not parse cached result, extracting concepts again")
    
    # If not in cache or cache error, extract concepts
    result = self.extract_concepts(content, ontology_source)
    
    # Store in cache with expiration
    if result and "error" not in result:
        try:
            redis_client.set(cache_key, json.dumps(result), ex=86400)  # 24 hour expiration
        except:
            logger.warning("Could not cache extraction result")
    
    return result
```

## Running Environment

### Standard Environment

To run the application with guidelines support:

```bash
# Start the application with enhanced server
./start_with_enhanced_ontology_server.sh
```

### GitHub Codespaces

```bash
# Start the application in Codespaces
./start_proethica_updated.sh
```

### Testing Guidelines Processing

```bash
# Test MCP server connection
./test_mcp_jsonrpc_connection.py --verbose

# Run full pipeline test
./run_guidelines_mcp_pipeline.sh
```

## Success Criteria

The following success criteria will be used to determine when each phase of implementation is complete:

### Phase 1: Improve Core Services
- All GuidelineAnalysisService methods have proper error handling
- MCP server connection failures are gracefully handled
- Concept extraction works reliably in all test cases

### Phase 2: Enhance User Interface
- Concept review interface is responsive and user-friendly
- UI provides clear feedback during long-running operations
- Relationship visualization is informative and interactive

### Phase 3: Optimize Performance
- Response time for concept extraction is < 5 seconds
- Batch processing can handle up to 10 guidelines simultaneously
- Caching reduces repeated extractions by > 90%

## Conclusion

The implementation roadmap focuses on three main areas: completing the MCP integration, enhancing the user interface, and optimizing performance. By addressing these priorities first, we will create a solid foundation for the more advanced features planned for the future.

The Guidelines Feature is a critical component of the AI Ethical DM system, providing users with powerful tools to analyze and understand ethical guidelines in the context of engineering ethics. Continuing development according to this plan will ensure the feature becomes increasingly valuable and user-friendly.
