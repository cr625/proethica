# REALM Integration Plan

This document outlines the integration plan for the REALM (Research Engineering And Materials Library) application, which leverages the Materials Science Engineering Ontology (MSEO) through a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.

## Architecture Overview

The REALM application is designed with a modular architecture that separates the core application from the ontology integration, allowing for flexibility and extensibility. The main components are:

1. **MSEO MCP Server**: A standalone server that provides access to the MSEO ontology data through a standardized API.
2. **REALM Flask Application**: A web application that provides a user interface for interacting with materials data.
3. **MCP Client**: A client library that allows the REALM application to communicate with the MCP server.

## Component Integration

### MSEO MCP Server

- The MSEO MCP server loads and manages the MSEO ontology data.
- It provides tools for searching, querying, and retrieving information from the ontology.
- It includes a chat completion tool that enhances LLM responses with ontology context.
- It serves as the knowledge source for materials science data.

### REALM Application

- The REALM application provides a web interface for users to interact with materials data.
- It includes a database that stores materialized views of ontology data for efficient querying.
- It synchronizes data with the MSEO ontology through the MCP server.
- It provides features for browsing, searching, comparing, and analyzing materials.

### MCP Client

- The MCP client handles communication between the REALM application and the MCP server.
- It provides methods for accessing MCP tools and resources.
- It abstracts the communication details, making it easy to use MCP capabilities in the application.

## Data Flow

1. **Ontology Synchronization**:
   - The MSEO MCP server loads the ontology data from files.
   - The REALM application requests material data from the MCP server.
   - The REALM application stores the material data in its database for efficient access.

2. **User Queries**:
   - Users can search for materials using the REALM web interface.
   - Searches can be based on material properties, categories, or text.
   - The application queries its database for basic searches.
   - For more complex queries, the application uses the MCP server.

3. **LLM-Assisted Interactions**:
   - Users can chat with an LLM that has been enhanced with ontology context.
   - The REALM application sends chat messages to the MCP server.
   - The MCP server enhances the system prompt with relevant ontology context.
   - The MCP server forwards the enhanced prompt to the LLM provider.
   - The LLM response is returned to the user through the REALM application.

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema

The REALM application uses a relational database with the following key tables:

- `materials`: Stores information about materials from the ontology.
- `material_categories`: Stores material categories.
- `material_properties`: Stores properties of materials.
- `material_categories`: Many-to-many relationship between materials and categories.

### API Endpoints

The REALM application provides RESTful API endpoints for:

- Retrieving materials and their properties.
- Searching for materials by various criteria.
- Comparing materials.
- Synchronizing with the MSEO ontology.
- Chatting with an ontology-enhanced LLM.

### MCP Communication

The REALM application communicates with the MCP server using HTTP requests:

- Tool execution uses POST requests to `/mcp/tool/{server_name}/{tool_name}`.
- Resource access uses GET requests to `/mcp/resource/{server_name}/{resource_uri}`.
- Server metadata is available at `/mcp/servers`.

## Deployment

The REALM application and MSEO MCP server can be deployed in several ways:

1. **Combined Deployment**: Both components run on the same server, with the MCP server running in a separate process or thread.
2. **Separate Deployment**: The MCP server and REALM application run on different servers, communicating over HTTP.
3. **Dockerized Deployment**: Each component runs in its own Docker container, managed with Docker Compose.

## Configuration

Configuration is managed through environment variables, with sensible defaults provided:

- `FLASK_CONFIG`: Sets the configuration environment (development, testing, production).
- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection URL.
- `MCP_BASE_URL`: Base URL for the MCP server.
- `MSEO_MCP_SERVER_NAME`: Name of the MSEO MCP server.
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`: API keys for LLM providers.

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Basic UI**: Create basic templates for browsing and searching materials.
2. **Enhance Data Synchronization**: Improve the process for synchronizing ontology data.
3. **Add User Authentication**: Implement user accounts and authentication.
4. **Develop Advanced Features**: Add more advanced features like material comparisons, property analysis, etc.
5. **Optimize Performance**: Improve performance through caching, indexing, and other optimizations.
6. **Add Visualization**: Implement visualizations for material properties and relationships.
7. **Expand Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation for users and developers.
