# ProEthica — Final Paper Outline (MASTER)
**Consolidated after Reviewer Feedback - Definitive Version**

*Created: May 23, 2025*  
*Status: MASTER OUTLINE - Use this as authoritative structure*

---

## **1. Introduction**

### 1.1 Problem Context 
LLM deployments in ethically sensitive domains, transparency shortfalls in professional contexts

### 1.2 Gap Analysis 
Absence of formal constraint mechanisms, precedent integration, and bidirectional validation

### 1.3 Proposed Solution Overview 
Ontology-constrained architecture that combines analogical reasoning with evaluative-AI concepts to guide and audit LLM outputs

### 1.4 Key Contributions 
- (i) Role-grounded professional-ethics ontology
- (ii) Multi-metric precedent retrieval  
- (iii) Bidirectional LLM-ontology interface via MCP
- (iv) FIRAC-based validation framework

### 1.5 Paper Organisation *(Optional)*

---

## **2. Background and Related Work**

### 2.1 Computational Ethics & Role Theory

### 2.2 Prior Systems 
Case-based, ontological, professional-ethics tools

### 2.3 LLM-Based Moral Reasoning 
Limitations emphasized

### 2.4 Related Work on Validation Methodologies 
Ethical-AI systems that report experimental evaluation; contrasts the metrics they adopt

*Rationale: keeping all literature material contiguous meets reviewers' request to avoid scattering foundational and comparative references.*

---

## **3. Proposed Approach**

### 3.1 Requirements Table 
Ethical-reasoning needs ⇄ ProEthica features (role obligations, constraint enforcement, precedent retrieval, etc.)

### 3.2 Conceptual Framework 
High-level diagram/flowchart before any implementation details

### 3.3 Concrete Example Scenario 
NSPE Case 23-4 walkthrough illustrating analogical reasoning

### 3.4 Technical Implementation 
MCP-enabled bidirectional interface, database and vector index, constraint-checking pipeline (kept concise; code-level specifics relegated to appendix)

---

## **4. Study**

### 4.1 Research Hypothesis 
**Ontology-constrained prompts yield higher alignment and persuasiveness than unconstrained baselines**

### 4.2 Corpus & Data 
20 NSPE cases, structured via world-creation process

### 4.3 Processing Pipeline 
Detailed rule-parsing mechanism, FIRAC annotation

### 4.4 Validation Approach 
Leave-one-out procedure, three-condition comparison, metrics defined (accuracy, reasoning quality, alignment)

### 4.5 Evaluation Metrics 
Formal definitions; FIRAC acronym spelled out and contextualized

### 4.6 Participant Review Protocol 
Double-blind online platform, IRB exemption or independent expert reviewers to resolve conflict-of-interest

---

## **5. Results**

*Structured presentation of quantitative and qualitative findings (tables/figures referenced in text)*

---

## **6. Discussion**

### 6.1 Positioning vs. State-of-the-Art Validation Methods

### 6.2 Interpretation of Results 
In light of gap analysis; demonstration of ontology constraints and analogical reasoning benefits

---

## **7. Conclusion**

### 7.1 Summary of Contributions

### 7.2 Practical and Theoretical Implications

### 7.3 Limitations 
E.g., fixed English corpus, lack of explicit temporal modeling

### 7.4 Future Work 
- (i) Temporal reasoning module to capture evolving professional standards and case progression (addresses current temporal limitation)
- (ii) Multilingual guideline expansion to support cross-cultural adaptation (addresses language-specific corpus constraint)

---

## **8. Acknowledgments**

DARPA ITM support (both investigators), plus any institutional funding

---

## **Appendix A (un-numbered) - Polishing Checklist**

- Spell out every acronym at first use
- Italicize *e.g.* / *i.e.* within parentheses  
- Verify all figures and tables are cited in text
- Audit reference completeness and formatting

*(Placing the checklist after References avoids confusion while satisfying the reviewer's request.)*

## **Key Changes from Previous Versions**

### ✅ **Major Structural Improvements:**
1. **Section 3 Restructured**: Now starts with Requirements Table (3.1) before implementation details
2. **Hypothesis Positioning**: Moved to prominent position at 4.1
3. **Expert Review Conflict Resolved**: Section 4.6 addresses IRB/independent reviewer solution
4. **Future Work Scope Defined**: Temporal reasoning positioned as future enhancement rather than current implementation
5. **Related Work Consolidated**: All literature review in Section 2 as requested

### ✅ **Reviewer Feedback Addressed:**
- Requirements table explicitly added (3.1)
- Conceptual framework precedes implementation (3.2)
- FIRAC contextualization addressed (4.5)
- Evaluation metrics clarity improved (4.4)
- Discussion section added for results interpretation (6)
- Polishing checklist included as appendix

### ✅ **Academic Structure Enhanced:**
- Clear separation between conceptual and technical content
- Concrete example scenario prominent (3.3)
- MCP benefits highlighted appropriately (3.4)
- Professional polish requirements integrated
