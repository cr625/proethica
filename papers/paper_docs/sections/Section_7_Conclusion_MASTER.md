# 7. Conclusion

## 7.1 Summary of Contributions

This paper presents ProEthica, a system that integrates large language models with role-based ontologies to support ethical reasoning in professional contexts. The approach addresses critical gaps in current AI systems by providing structured mechanisms for incorporating domain-specific ethical obligations into automated reasoning processes while maintaining transparency and human agency.

Our work makes four primary contributions to computational ethics and AI systems design. First, we develop a role-grounded professional ethics ontology that formalizes ethical obligations, constraints, and precedent relationships within professional domains. This ontological framework provides the structured knowledge foundation necessary for systematic ethical analysis. Second, we introduce multi-metric precedent retrieval that combines vector similarity with ontological relationships and structural matching to identify relevant cases more effectively than purely embedding-based approaches. Third, we present a bidirectional LLM-ontology interface implemented through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that enables reliable constraint enforcement while preserving the generative capabilities needed for complex ethical reasoning. Fourth, we establish a FIRAC-based validation framework that provides systematic evaluation of ethical reasoning quality through structured annotation and expert review.

The evaluation on 20 NSPE engineering ethics cases demonstrates the practical effectiveness of ontology-constrained reasoning. Our system achieves 97% constraint compliance and 95% FIRAC structure adherence while processing cases in an average of 12.3 seconds. The leave-one-out methodology and comparative analysis provide evidence that structured ethical frameworks can improve both the quality and consistency of AI-generated ethical analysis compared to unconstrained baseline approaches.

The technical implementation through MCP-enabled architecture proves that complex ontological constraints can be effectively integrated with modern LLMs without requiring direct model access to knowledge structures. This design preserves model performance while adding systematic ethical reasoning capabilities, demonstrating a viable path for deploying AI ethics support in professional contexts.

## 7.2 Practical and Theoretical Implications

The results demonstrate that professional ethics applications benefit substantially from explicit constraint mechanisms rather than relying solely on general-purpose language model training. This finding has significant implications for the deployment of AI systems in domains where ethical considerations are paramount, including healthcare, engineering, legal practice, and business consulting. The structured approach enables organizations to embed their specific ethical frameworks directly into AI-supported decision-making processes.

From a theoretical perspective, the approach demonstrates that AI systems can provide meaningful support for ethical decision-making without claiming autonomous moral agency. By positioning the LLM as a reasoning tool constrained by formal ethical frameworks, the system preserves human responsibility while providing structured analytical support. This design addresses fundamental concerns about delegating ethical judgment to AI systems while leveraging their capabilities for complex text analysis, precedent identification, and reasoning structure generation.

The role-based ontological modeling provides a systematic pathway for incorporating diverse professional ethical frameworks into computational systems. The world-based organization enables domain-specific customization while maintaining consistent architectural principles across different professional contexts. This approach offers scalable methods for adapting ethical reasoning support to new domains without requiring complete system redesign.

The integration of analogical reasoning with formal constraint mechanisms bridges traditional case-based reasoning approaches with modern large language model capabilities. This synthesis suggests new directions for combining symbolic and neural approaches to ethical reasoning that maintain the benefits of both paradigms.

## 7.3 Limitations

Several important limitations constrain the scope and generalizability of these findings. The evaluation focuses exclusively on engineering ethics cases from a single professional organization (NSPE), representing a fixed English corpus that may not capture the full complexity of ethical reasoning across diverse professional contexts. Different domains may require alternative ontological structures, reasoning approaches, or evaluation frameworks that our current system does not address.

The lack of explicit temporal modeling represents a significant limitation in professional ethics applications. Our current approach treats ethical principles and precedents as static, yet professional standards evolve through new cases, changing social contexts, and emerging technologies. The system cannot currently track how obligations develop over time or how precedent relationships change as new cases emerge.

The system requires substantial preprocessing effort to create domain-specific ontologies and annotate case structures using expert knowledge. This requirement may limit practical deployment in domains without established case repositories, codified ethical frameworks, or available expertise for ontology development. The dependence on expert knowledge for constraint specification introduces potential bias in the reasoning mechanisms.

The evaluation methodology, while systematic, relies on a relatively small case base and focuses on written case analysis. Real-world ethical decision-making often involves time pressure, incomplete information, interpersonal dynamics, and contextual factors that written scenarios cannot fully capture. The participant review approach, though structured, may not reflect the full range of stakeholder perspectives relevant to complex ethical decisions.

## 7.4 Future Work

Two primary research directions emerge from the limitations identified in this work and the broader goals of computational ethics support. **Temporal reasoning module development** represents the most critical enhancement to address current system constraints by capturing evolving professional standards and case progression. This module would track how ethical principles adapt through precedent development, regulatory changes, and social context evolution while maintaining consistency with established frameworks. Implementation would require sophisticated mechanisms for modeling precedent hierarchies, temporal validity of constraints, and dynamic obligation evolution that could transform static ethical frameworks into adaptive reasoning systems.

**Multilingual guideline expansion to support cross-cultural adaptation** addresses the language-specific corpus constraint by developing ontological representations that account for cultural variation in ethical frameworks while maintaining computational tractability. This expansion would require systematic investigation of how professional ethics principles vary across cultural contexts, development of cross-cultural ontological mapping techniques, and validation across diverse linguistic and cultural communities. Such capabilities would be essential for deploying ethical reasoning support in global professional contexts where cultural sensitivity is paramount.

Beyond these priority areas, several additional research directions warrant investigation. Cross-domain evaluation would test the generalizability of ontology-constrained approaches across medical ethics, legal practice, and business ethics contexts. Integration with real-time decision support systems would require addressing latency constraints and user interface design for interactive ethical guidance. Investigation of emotional and interpersonal factors would extend current logical analysis approaches to incorporate the human elements that often dominate real ethical decisions.

The development of automated ontology extraction and updating mechanisms could reduce the expert knowledge bottleneck while maintaining reasoning quality. Advanced evaluation frameworks incorporating stakeholder diversity, longitudinal analysis, and real-world deployment metrics would strengthen confidence in system effectiveness across diverse professional contexts.
