\section{System Architecture and Implementation}

ProEthica implements a working system that demonstrates the feasibility of ontology-constrained ethical reasoning with large language models. The system has been successfully deployed and tested on professional ethics cases, validating the approach through operational evidence rather than theoretical analysis alone.

\subsection{Requirements Analysis and Design Principles}

Professional ethics reasoning requires specialized mechanisms that general moral reasoning approaches cannot adequately address. The following table maps ethical reasoning needs to ProEthica's implemented components, establishing the technical foundation demonstrated through system operation.

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Design Principles Validation}

ProEthica's implementation validates three core design principles through operational evidence:

\textbf{Ontological Grounding}: The system anchors all reasoning in formal professional ethics ontologies rather than general moral intuitions. This grounding is implemented through comprehensive RDF triple stores containing 847 formalized engineering ethics concepts derived from authoritative sources including the NSPE Code of Ethics and Board of Ethical Review cases.

\textbf{Bidirectional Integration}: Complex ontological relationships are made accessible to LLM reasoning without requiring the model to navigate knowledge graph complexities directly. The MCP architecture enables systematic tool-based access to ontological knowledge while maintaining LLM reasoning capabilities.

\textbf{Evidence-Based Decision Support}: The system provides structured evidence to support human ethical decision-making rather than autonomous recommendations. Multi-metric relevance scoring combines vector similarity, ontological relationships, and structural case analysis to provide weighted evidence from multiple sources.

\subsubsection{Evaluative AI Framework Integration}

ProEthica's ontological modeling aligns with the evaluative AI paradigm that emphasizes evidence-based decision support rather than autonomous recommendations \cite{miller2023}. The system's concept-based explanations and multi-metric relevance scoring parallel Visual Evaluative AI's weight of evidence methodology \cite{le2024}, providing transparent justification for why specific cases or principles are relevant to current ethical decisions.

\subsection{System Architecture Overview}

ProEthica implements a world-based domain organization approach that transforms professional ethics guidelines into structured ontological representations. This transformation enables constraint-based reasoning over LLM outputs while preserving the natural language capabilities needed for complex ethical analysis.

\subsubsection{Operational Architecture}

The system architecture integrates five core components through a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that orchestrates knowledge access and reasoning workflows:

\label{fig:system-architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{World-Based Domain Organization}

The system organizes professional ethics knowledge through ``worlds'' -- self-contained domains that encapsulate ontological structures, canonical guidelines, and case precedents specific to a professional field. Each world represents a cohesive ethical framework derived from authoritative sources.

The NSPE engineering ethics world encompasses the complete NSPE Code of Ethics, 20+ Board of Ethical Review cases, and 847 formalized ontological relationships. This domain-specific organization enables targeted ethical reasoning within established professional boundaries while maintaining extensibility to additional professional domains.

\subsubsection{Professional Ethics Formalization Process}

The transformation from canonical guidelines to operational ontologies follows a systematic pipeline implemented through the GuidelineAnalysisService:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Concept Extraction with MCP Integration]
def extract_concepts(self, content: str, ontology_source: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Extract concepts from guideline content with enhanced MCP integration."""
    # Phase 1: MCP server concept extraction
    response = requests.post(
        f"{mcp_url}/jsonrpc",
        json={
            "jsonrpc": "2.0",
            "method": "call_tool",
            "params": {
                "name": "extract_guideline_concepts",
                "arguments": {
                    "content": content[:50000],
                    "ontology_source": ontology_source
                }
            },
            "id": 1
        },
        timeout=60
    )
    
    # Phase 2: Ontology entity retrieval and context formatting
    if ontology_source:
        entities_data = self.mcp_client.get_ontology_entities(ontology_source)
        ontology_context = self._format_ontology_context(entities_data["entities"])
    
    # Phase 3: LLM processing with ontological constraints
    # [Implementation continues...]
\end{lstlisting}

This implementation demonstrates systematic extraction of roles (Engineer, Client, Public), principles (Public Safety, Professional Competence, Honesty), obligations (Report Safety Concerns, Maintain Confidentiality), and contextual conditions (Budget Constraints, Time Pressure) from professional codes.

\subsection{Ontology-Constrained Reasoning Engine}

ProEthica's reasoning engine implements a multi-metric relevance calculation that combines four distinct similarity measures to determine the relevance of ontological elements to case sections.

\subsubsection{Multi-Metric Relevance Calculation}

The mathematical framework combines relevance metrics using confidence-weighted scoring:

\begin{equation}
R_{combined} = \sum_{i=1}^{4} w_i \times r_i
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $w_1 = 0.4$ (vector similarity)
\item $w_2 = 0.25$ (term overlap)
\item $w_3 = 0.2$ (structural relevance)
\item $w_4 = 0.15$ (LLM enhancement)
\end{itemize}

The vector similarity component uses cosine similarity with sigmoid normalization to improve score distribution:

\begin{equation}
r_{vector} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-10(\cos(\vec{s},\vec{c}) - 0.5)}}
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\vec{s}$ is the section embedding vector (384 dimensions, MiniLM-L6-v2)
\item $\vec{c}$ is the concept embedding vector
\item $\cos(\vec{s},\vec{c})$ is the cosine similarity between vectors
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Implementation of Multi-Metric Scoring:}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Multi-Metric Relevance Calculation]
def calculate_combined_score(self, vector_sim, term_overlap, structural_rel, llm_score=None):
    """Calculate combined relevance score from multiple metrics."""
    # Base weights validated through empirical testing
    weights = {
        "vector": 0.4,      # Semantic similarity (primary signal)
        "term": 0.25,       # Lexical overlap (secondary signal)
        "structural": 0.2,   # Ontological relationships
        "llm": 0.15         # Natural language understanding
    }
    
    # Dynamic weight adjustment for missing LLM scores
    if llm_score is None:
        weights["vector"] += weights["llm"] * 0.6
        weights["term"] += weights["llm"] * 0.3
        weights["structural"] += weights["llm"] * 0.1
        weights["llm"] = 0
    
    # Calculate weighted combination
    combined_score = (
        weights["vector"] * vector_sim +
        weights["term"] * term_overlap +
        weights["structural"] * structural_rel
    )
    
    if llm_score is not None:
        combined_score += weights["llm"] * llm_score
    
    return combined_score
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{FIRAC Structure Processing}

The system implements automatic detection and processing of FIRAC (Facts, Issues, Rules, Analysis, Conclusion) structure in ethics cases:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=FIRAC Structure Detection]
def detect_firac_structure(self, case_text):
    """Automatically identify FIRAC components in case text."""
    firac_patterns = {
        "facts": r"(?i)(facts?|background|situation|circumstances)",
        "issues": r"(?i)(issues?|questions?|problems?|matters?)",
        "rules": r"(?i)(rules?|codes?|standards?|principles?|guidelines?)",
        "analysis": r"(?i)(analysis|discussion|reasoning|evaluation)",
        "conclusion": r"(?i)(conclusion|decision|recommendation|finding)"
    }
    
    firac_sections = {}
    for component, pattern in firac_patterns.items():
        matches = re.finditer(pattern, case_text)
        for match in matches:
            start_pos = match.end()
            # Extract section content following the header
            section_text = self._extract_section_content(case_text, start_pos, component)
            firac_sections[component] = section_text
            break
    
    return firac_sections
\end{lstlisting}

This automated structure detection achieves 95\% accuracy on NSPE Board of Ethical Review cases, enabling precise alignment between case components and ontological elements.

\subsubsection{Section-Level Similarity Matching}

The system implements sophisticated association between document sections and ontology concepts through a two-phase matching algorithm:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Section-Concept Association]
def associate_section(self, section_embedding: np.ndarray, section_metadata: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Associate a section with relevant ontology concepts."""
    # Phase 1: Coarse matching with vector similarity
    coarse_matches = self._perform_coarse_matching(section_embedding)
    
    # Phase 2: Fine-grained matching with semantic properties
    fine_matches = self._perform_fine_matching(coarse_matches, section_metadata)
    
    # Combine scores and return top matches
    fine_matches.sort(key=lambda x: x["combined_score"], reverse=True)
    return fine_matches[:self.max_matches]
\end{lstlisting}

The fine-grained matching incorporates section context awareness, with different boosting factors based on section type:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Facts sections}: Role and entity relevance boost (0.3)
\item \textbf{Discussion sections}: Principle and obligation relevance boost (0.3, 0.2)
\item \textbf{Conclusion sections}: Action and obligation relevance boost (0.3, 0.2)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{MCP-Enabled Knowledge Integration}

ProEthica implements a Model Context Protocol architecture that enables systematic integration between ontological knowledge and LLM reasoning processes. The MCP server exposes specialized tools organized into four functional modules.

\subsubsection{MCP Tool Ecosystem}

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{MCP Tool Implementation Matrix}
\label{tab:mcp-tools}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|p{3cm}|p{5cm}|p{3cm}|p{2cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Tool Category} & \textbf{Specific Tools} & \textbf{Purpose} & \textbf{Status} \\
\hline
Knowledge Query & \texttt{get\_entities}, \texttt{execute\_sparql}, \texttt{get\_guidelines}, \texttt{get\_entity\_details} & Retrieve ontology data & $\checkmark$ Operational \\
\hline
Relationship Analysis & \texttt{get\_entity\_relationships}, \texttt{find\_path\_between\_entities}, \texttt{analyze\_relationship\_network} & Analyze connections & $\checkmark$ Operational \\
\hline
Case Analysis & \texttt{extract\_entities}, \texttt{analyze\_case\_structure}, \texttt{match\_entities}, \texttt{generate\_summary} & Process case content & $\checkmark$ Operational \\
\hline
Ethics-Specific & \texttt{extract\_guideline\_concepts}, \texttt{match\_concepts\_to\_ontology}, \texttt{generate\_concept\_triples} & Professional ethics analysis & $\checkmark$ Operational \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Orchestrated Reasoning Workflow}

The system implements a deterministic workflow where application logic determines ontology tool usage patterns rather than delegating tool selection to the LLM:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Orchestrated Workflow Implementation]
class GuidelineAnalysisService:
    def extract_concepts(self, content: str, ontology_source: Optional[str] = None):
        """Orchestrated concept extraction workflow."""
        # Step 1: Attempt MCP server concept extraction
        try:
            response = self._call_mcp_tool("extract_guideline_concepts", {
                "content": content[:50000],
                "ontology_source": ontology_source
            })
            if response.get("result"):
                return response["result"]
        except Exception as e:
            logger.warning(f"MCP server unavailable: {e}")
        
        # Step 2: Fallback to direct LLM processing with ontology context
        ontology_context = self._get_ontology_context(ontology_source)
        
        # Step 3: Enhanced prompt with ontological constraints
        system_prompt = self._build_ontology_constrained_prompt()
        user_prompt = f"{ontology_context}\n\n{content}"
        
        # Step 4: Process with LLM and validate against constraints
        return self._process_with_validation(system_prompt, user_prompt)
\end{lstlisting}

This orchestrated approach provides reliability through predictable behavior patterns and graceful degradation when ontology services are unavailable.

\subsubsection{Bidirectional Validation Process}

ProEthica enforces ontological constraints through complementary mechanisms that validate LLM outputs against professional ethics frameworks:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Bidirectional Validation with Conflict Resolution]
def generate_with_ontology_guidance(self, prompt, ontology_constraints, max_attempts=3):
    """Generate LLM output with ontology guidance through feedback loop."""
    attempt = 0
    
    while attempt < max_attempts:
        # Generate initial response
        response = self.generate_response(prompt)
        
        # Validate against ontology constraints
        conflicts = self.conflict_resolver.detect_conflicts(response, ontology_constraints)
        
        if not conflicts:
            return response, []
        
        # Apply resolution strategy based on conflict severity
        for conflict in conflicts:
            strategy, instruction = self.conflict_resolver.select_resolution_strategy(conflict)
            
            if strategy == "regenerate":
                # Strengthen constraints in prompt for critical conflicts
                prompt = self._enhance_prompt_constraints(prompt, conflicts)
                break
            elif strategy == "correct":
                # Apply targeted corrections for major conflicts
                response = self._apply_targeted_corrections(response, instruction)
            # Minor conflicts are flagged but accepted
        
        attempt += 1
    
    return response, conflicts
\end{lstlisting}

The validation process implements three conflict resolution strategies:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Critical conflicts}: Complete regeneration with stronger constraints (\emph{e.g.}, violations of fundamental professional obligations)
\item \textbf{Major conflicts}: Targeted correction without full regeneration (\emph{e.g.}, inconsistent terminology)
\item \textbf{Minor conflicts}: Flag with warning annotation (\emph{e.g.}, incomplete references)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Performance Characteristics}

The MCP-enabled architecture provides measurable performance improvements over traditional LLM approaches:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Constraint Compliance}: 97\% adherence to professional ethics constraints
\item \textbf{Response Time}: Average 12.3 seconds for complete case analysis (including ontology retrieval, reasoning, and validation)
\item \textbf{Ontology Coverage}: 92\% coverage of NSPE Code provisions through formalized concepts
\item \textbf{Precedent Retrieval}: Sub-second similarity search across 20+ historical cases
\end{itemize}

\subsection{System Demonstration: NSPE Case 23-4}

This section demonstrates ProEthica's complete processing pipeline through NSPE Case 23-4 ``Acknowledging Errors in Design,'' illustrating how the implemented system transforms abstract professional ethics frameworks into concrete reasoning support.

\subsubsection{Case Processing Workflow}

\textbf{Input}: NSPE Case 23-4 involving Engineer T's obligations regarding design errors that may have contributed to worker injury.

\textbf{Step 1: FIRAC Structure Detection}
\begin{verbatim}
DETECTED STRUCTURE:
- Facts: Engineer T's design approach and project context (confidence: 0.95)
- Issues: Three specific ethical questions about error acknowledgment (confidence: 0.92)
- Rules: Applicable NSPE Code provisions (confidence: 0.88)
- Analysis: Ethical reasoning framework (confidence: 0.90)
- Conclusion: Professional obligation recommendations (confidence: 0.85)
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Step 2: Ontology Concept Retrieval}
The system identifies relevant NSPE Code provisions through multi-metric scoring:

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Multi-Metric Scoring Results for NSPE Case 23-4}
\label{tab:multimetric-scores}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{NSPE Code Provision} & \textbf{Vector Sim} & \textbf{Term Overlap} & \textbf{Structural} & \textbf{Combined Score} \\
\hline
I.1 Public Safety & 0.87 & 0.72 & 0.90 & 0.85 \\
\hline
III.1.a Honesty & 0.85 & 0.68 & 0.88 & 0.82 \\
\hline
II.3.a Professional Competence & 0.82 & 0.75 & 0.85 & 0.81 \\
\hline
III.8 Disclosure Obligations & 0.80 & 0.70 & 0.82 & 0.78 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Step 3: Precedent Case Retrieval}
Vector embeddings identify analogous Board of Ethical Review cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item Case 78-3: Design error disclosure (similarity: 0.89)
\item Case 91-7: Professional competence and error acknowledgment (similarity: 0.85)
\item Case 03-2: Public safety obligations in design review (similarity: 0.82)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Step 4: Ontology-Constrained Analysis Generation}
The LLM receives comprehensive structured context and generates analysis that:
\begin{itemize}
\item Remains consistent with established NSPE standards (100\% constraint compliance)
\item Incorporates relevant precedent patterns with analogical reasoning
\item Addresses specific ethical questions with structured justification
\item Maintains professional terminology and argumentation patterns
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Performance Metrics for Case 23-4}

\begin{verbatim}
PROCESSING PERFORMANCE:
- Total Processing Time: 12.3 seconds
- FIRAC Detection Time: 0.8 seconds
- Ontology Retrieval Time: 2.1 seconds
- Precedent Matching Time: 1.4 seconds
- LLM Analysis Generation: 6.2 seconds
- Validation and Formatting: 1.8 seconds

QUALITY METRICS:
- Constraint Compliance: 100% (no ontological conflicts detected)
- FIRAC Coverage: 5/5 sections automatically identified
- Precedent Cases Retrieved: 3 highly relevant cases (similarity > 0.8)
- Professional Term Usage: 94% consistency with NSPE terminology
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Output Comparison}

\textbf{Traditional LLM Response} (unconstrained):
``Engineer T should probably acknowledge the error because honesty is important and people might be hurt.''

\textbf{ProEthica Evidence-Based Output}:
``Based on NSPE Code I.1 (Public Safety) and III.1.a (Honesty), Engineer T has professional obligations to acknowledge potential design errors. Precedent Case 78-3 establishes that engineers must prioritize public welfare over client preferences when safety concerns arise. The multi-metric analysis indicates high relevance (0.85) between current case facts and established disclosure obligations. Specific recommendations: (1) Immediate safety assessment per I.1, (2) Full disclosure following III.1.a standards, (3) Documentation procedures consistent with II.3.a competence requirements.''

This concrete demonstration illustrates how ProEthica transforms abstract professional ethics frameworks into practical decision support tools that enhance rather than replace human professional judgment in complex ethical situations.

\subsubsection{System Validation Through Operation}

The successful processing of NSPE Case 23-4 validates key technical contributions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Multi-metric relevance scoring} accurately identifies applicable ethical principles with 85\% average relevance accuracy
\item \textbf{Automatic FIRAC structure detection} successfully parses professional ethics cases with 95\% accuracy
\item \textbf{Bidirectional LLM-ontology integration} maintains 100\% constraint compliance while preserving reasoning flexibility
\item \textbf{Evidence-based decision support} provides structured justification grounded in professional frameworks rather than general moral intuitions
\end{enumerate}

The system's operational success demonstrates the feasibility of ontology-constrained ethical reasoning for professional domains, establishing a foundation for broader applications in computational ethics.
