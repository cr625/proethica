## Ontological Approaches to Professional Ethics

Research on using domain ontologies and knowledge graphs to structure professional ethics content for AI systems represents a practical alternative to encoding universal ethical principles directly in ontologies. This approach focuses on organizing professional codes, case precedents, and domain-specific ethical frameworks rather than abstract moral reasoning.

**Professional Domain Standards**: The IEEE 7007–2021 Ontological Standard provides a pioneering framework for ethically driven robotics and automation systems, emphasizing domain-specific ontologies that include ethical considerations such as data privacy, transparency, responsibility, and accountability tailored to cyber-physical systems (Houghtaling et al., n.d.; Prestes et al., n.d.). This standard exemplifies how ontological structures can support ethically aligned design in specific professional domains.

**Legal Knowledge Ontologies**: The development of the Ontology of Professional Judicial Knowledge (OPJK) demonstrates how ontologies can represent complex legal knowledge, facilitating management and application of legal information in e-government and e-democracy contexts (Casellas, 2011; Vallbé et al., 2010). This approach shows how domain-specific ontological structures can organize professional knowledge for practical application.

**Case-Oriented Ontological Models**: The Case-Oriented Ontological Model (COOM) and Hyper-Knowledge Graph System (HKGS) are designed to model AI ethics cases by capturing event, relational, and positional attributes, allowing exploration of correlations between cases and providing dynamic visual analysis of ethical issues across domains (Chen et al., 2024). These models demonstrate how ontological structures can organize case precedents for professional ethics applications.

**Requirements Engineering Approaches**: Ontology-based Requirements Engineering (ObRE) applies ontological analysis to unpack ethicality requirements in AI systems, focusing on specific ethical principles like Beneficence, Non-maleficence, Explicability, and Autonomy, providing guidelines for requirements elicitation and analysis in software development (Guizzardi et al., 2023).

**Professional Ethics by Design**: The concept of "Professional Ethics by Design" advocates for co-creation of codes of conduct for computational practice across various fields, emphasizing development of professional ethics frameworks specific to computational practices rather than relying on abstract ethical principles (Danzon-Chambaud & Foissac, 2023).
