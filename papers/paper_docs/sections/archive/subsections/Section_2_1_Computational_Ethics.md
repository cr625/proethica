## Enhanced Background Section

### Computational Ethics Framework
Computational ethics represents an interdisciplinary effort to translate ethical theory into machine-operable representations, addressing the computational complexity of moral reasoning and decision-making (Stenseke, 2024). This field has evolved from early attempts at formalizing ethical principles to sophisticated approaches that recognize the inherent complexity and context-dependency of moral judgments. Contemporary computational ethics emphasizes the integration of multiple approaches, from rule-based systems to case-based reasoning, acknowledging that different ethical challenges may require different computational strategies.

### Role-Based Ethics: Foundations and Applications
Role-based ethics, with historical roots traceable to ancient philosophy including Epictetus, emphasizes duty tied to social and professional roles rather than universal moral principles (Peterson, 2017). This approach recognizes that individuals occupy multiple roles simultaneously—as professionals, community members, and private individuals—each carrying distinct moral obligations that may sometimes conflict.

Contemporary research has demonstrated the practical importance of role-based ethics in professional contexts. Cooper and Marder (2023) examine role morality discrepancy in professional purchasing decisions, showing how individuals experience tension between personal moral standards and professional role expectations. Their work reveals that felt responsibility in professional contexts is significantly influenced by how individuals interpret their role-based obligations, supporting the theoretical foundation that professional ethics requires domain-specific approaches rather than universal moral frameworks.

### Case-Based Reasoning in Practical Ethics
A foundational approach to computational ethics involves case-based reasoning (CBR), which draws on the principle of treating like cases alike—a concept traceable to Aristotelian ethics (Ashley & McLaren, 1995). Ashley and McLaren's seminal work on CBR knowledge representation for practical ethics established that practical ethical reasoning often involves comparative evaluation of problems rather than deductive application of abstract principles. This approach recognizes that ethical principles can be inconsistent or poorly defined in their antecedents, making pure deductive reasoning insufficient for complex moral decisions.

The CBR approach to ethics is particularly relevant in professional domains where abstract principles must be applied to concrete factual scenarios. As Ashley and McLaren (1995) demonstrate, practical ethical reasoning supplements weak analytic models with comparative evaluation, allowing decision-makers to construct arguments by comparing current problems to past paradigmatic cases. This approach implements a form of bottom-up ethical decision-making that complements top-down principle-based approaches.

### Professional Ethics and Contextual Evaluation
Role-based ethics operates not as a universal standard but through localized professional obligations that vary by domain, role responsibilities, and situational context (Wallach & Allen, 2009). This contextual variation makes role-based ethics particularly suitable for ontological modeling, where domain-specific ethical frameworks can capture the nuanced obligations that characterize different professional roles.

The integration of role-based ethics with computational approaches requires structured modeling of professional roles, duties, and contextual evaluation mechanisms. This includes the development of ontological representations that can capture both the explicit rules of professional codes and the implicit knowledge embedded in precedent cases and expert decision-making patterns.

## Key Improvements:

1. **Strengthened CBR foundation** - Ashley & McLaren (1995) provides the foundational work on case-based reasoning in ethics
2. **Contemporary role morality research** - Cooper & Marder (2023) shows current research on role-based obligations
3. **Updated computational ethics** - Stenseke (2024) provides more recent work than the 2023 reference
4. **Enhanced prior systems** - Added Tolmeijer et al. (2021) survey and Waser (2014) medical ethics work
5. **Stronger theoretical grounding** - Better connection between classical ethics, case-based reasoning, and computational implementation

This creates a much stronger theoretical foundation for your ontology-constrained approach by showing how it builds on established CBR work while addressing limitations of previous systems.
