# 3.3 Ontological Modeling of Ethical Scenarios

ProEthica employs a comprehensive ontological modeling approach that transforms unstructured professional ethics guidelines into machine-interpretable representations while preserving the semantic richness and contextual nuances essential for ethical reasoning. The modeling process addresses the challenge of formalizing inherently context-dependent ethical knowledge into structured representations suitable for computational analysis.

## World Creation and Domain-Specific Framework Organization

The ontological modeling process begins with world creation, a systematic transformation of canonical professional guidelines into structured knowledge representations. Each professional domain requires specialized ontological structures that capture domain-specific roles, obligations, principles, and contextual factors.

**Canonical Guideline Processing**: Professional codes undergo automated analysis using specialized parsing techniques that identify semantic structures, hierarchical relationships, and implicit constraints. For the NSPE Code of Ethics, this process extracts fundamental principles (Public Safety, Professional Competence, Honesty), role-specific obligations (Engineers must report safety concerns), and contextual modifiers (when competence is challenged, when confidentiality conflicts arise).

**Concept Hierarchy Development**: Extracted concepts are organized into taxonomical hierarchies that preserve the logical structure of professional ethics frameworks. Core principles form the foundation, with specific obligations and contextual applications structured as specializations that inherit base properties while adding domain-specific constraints.

**Relationship Formalization**: Professional ethics relationships are encoded as formal predicates that specify allowable interactions between ontological entities. These relationships capture not only explicit rules but also implicit professional expectations and contextual dependencies.

## Document Structure Annotation Using BFO Principles

The system employs Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) principles for semantic segmentation of ethical case documents, ensuring consistent structural interpretation across diverse case types. This annotation process transforms unstructured case narratives into semantically tagged components suitable for targeted analysis.

**FIRAC Structure Detection**: Cases undergo automatic analysis to identify Facts, Issues, Rules, Analysis, and Conclusion sections using a hybrid approach combining rule-based pattern recognition with machine learning classification. The detection algorithm employs linguistic markers, structural cues, and content analysis to achieve robust segmentation across varied case formats.

**Semantic Role Assignment**: Each identified section receives semantic annotations that specify its role within the ethical reasoning framework. Facts sections are tagged with factual assertions and contextual information, Issues sections identify ethical dilemmas and conflicts, Rules sections reference applicable professional standards, Analysis sections contain reasoning processes, and Conclusion sections present ethical determinations.

**Entity Recognition and Linking**: Professional roles, actions, outcomes, and principles mentioned within case content are identified and linked to corresponding ontological entities. This linking process enables systematic analysis of how abstract principles apply to concrete scenarios.

## RDF Triple Representation of Agents, Actions, and Outcomes

Ethical scenarios are formalized as RDF triple networks that capture the essential elements of ethical situations while maintaining flexibility for complex relationship modeling.

**Agent Modeling**: Professional actors are represented as ontological entities with associated role properties, obligations, and capabilities. An Engineer entity carries inherent obligations for public safety, professional competence, and honest disclosure, while Client entities possess rights to confidentiality and competent service.

**Action Representation**: Professional actions are modeled as processes that connect agents, objects, and outcomes through temporal and causal relationships. Actions inherit constraints from agent roles and contextual factors, enabling systematic evaluation of action appropriateness within professional ethical frameworks.

**Outcome Formalization**: Ethical consequences are represented as outcome states that can be evaluated against professional standards and public welfare considerations. This enables systematic analysis of action consequences and their alignment with professional obligations.

**Contextual Factor Integration**: Situational elements such as resource constraints, time pressures, conflicting obligations, and stakeholder interests are modeled as contextual modifiers that influence the applicability and priority of ethical principles.

## Professional Ethics Formalization: Guidelines to Ontological Extensions

The transformation from textual guidelines to operational ontologies requires systematic formalization that preserves semantic content while enabling computational reasoning.

**Obligation Extraction and Formalization**: Professional codes contain explicit and implicit obligations that must be systematically identified and formalized. The system employs natural language processing techniques combined with domain expertise to extract obligation statements, identify their scope and conditions, and formalize them as logical constraints.

**Principle Hierarchy Development**: Ethical principles exist in hierarchical relationships where fundamental principles (such as public welfare) may take precedence over specific professional considerations (such as client loyalty) in conflict situations. The ontology captures these hierarchical relationships and provides mechanisms for principled conflict resolution.

**Constraint Representation**: Professional ethical constraints are encoded as logical rules that specify permissible and prohibited actions under various circumstances. These constraints enable systematic evaluation of proposed actions against professional standards.

## Connection to Evaluative AI Frameworks

ProEthica's ontological modeling aligns with evaluative AI principles that emphasize evidence-based decision support rather than autonomous recommendations. The ontological structure provides systematic organization of professional ethics evidence while preserving human agency in ethical decision-making.

**Evidence-Based Decision Support**: The ontological model organizes professional ethics knowledge to support systematic evidence evaluation rather than automated ethical judgment. This approach reflects the evaluative AI paradigm's emphasis on enhancing human reasoning capabilities rather than replacing human judgment.

**Concept-Based Explanations**: The structured ontological representation enables concept-based explanations that trace ethical reasoning back to specific professional principles, precedent cases, and contextual factors. This transparency supports the evaluative AI requirement for interpretable decision support.

**Weight of Evidence Integration**: The multi-metric relevance scoring system implements a weight of evidence methodology where multiple sources of ethical evidence (precedent cases, professional principles, contextual factors) are systematically integrated to support comprehensive ethical analysis.

**Human Agency Preservation**: The ontological model provides structured context for human ethical reasoning while explicitly avoiding autonomous ethical judgment. This design reflects cognitive psychology principles for explainable complex systems that enhance rather than replace human decision-making capabilities.

## Semantic Document Structure Implementation

The implementation of semantic document structure annotation enables systematic analysis of case components and their relationship to professional ethical frameworks.

**Section-Level Semantic Tagging**: Each document section receives semantic tags that specify its evidential role within ethical reasoning. Facts sections provide empirical evidence, Issues sections identify ethical conflicts, Rules sections establish applicable standards, Analysis sections present reasoning processes, and Conclusion sections document ethical determinations.

**Cross-Reference Resolution**: References between case sections and external professional standards are automatically identified and formalized as ontological relationships, enabling systematic tracing of ethical reasoning chains.

**Precedent Pattern Recognition**: Similar structural patterns across cases are identified and formalized as precedent templates that can guide analysis of new ethical scenarios.
