# 3.6 Implementation Architecture

ProEthica implements a modular architecture that integrates multiple specialized components to enable ontology-constrained ethical reasoning. The architecture addresses the technical challenges of combining structured knowledge representation, vector similarity search, and large language model inference within a cohesive system that supports both research experimentation and practical application.

## System Components Integration

The implementation employs three primary components that interact through well-defined APIs and data protocols:

**Flask Web Application**: Serves as the central orchestration layer, managing user interactions, coordinating component communication, and maintaining application state. The Flask application implements the primary business logic for case analysis, ontology management, and reasoning workflow coordination.

**Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server**: Provides specialized tools for ontology access, concept extraction, and structured knowledge retrieval. The MCP server implements the bidirectional LLM-ontology integration by exposing ontological knowledge through standardized tool interfaces while maintaining semantic consistency and constraint enforcement.

**PostgreSQL Database with pgvector Extension**: Manages persistent storage for ontological knowledge, case documents, and embedding vectors. The pgvector extension enables efficient similarity search over high-dimensional embedding spaces while maintaining ACID transaction properties for data consistency.

## World-Based Database Organization

The database architecture implements world-based organization through specialized schemas that isolate domain-specific knowledge while enabling cross-domain analysis when appropriate.

**Ontology Storage**: Professional ethics ontologies are stored using a combination of relational tables for structured metadata and JSON fields for flexible RDF triple representation. This hybrid approach balances query efficiency with semantic expressiveness.

**Document Management**: Cases and guidelines are stored with comprehensive metadata including provenance, temporal information, and structural annotations. Document sections are stored separately to enable fine-grained retrieval and analysis.

**Embedding Management**: Vector embeddings for document sections and ontological concepts are stored using pgvector's optimized storage format, with HNSW indices providing sub-linear similarity search performance.

## Multi-Dimensional Vector Integration

The system implements sophisticated vector similarity capabilities that support both exact and approximate nearest neighbor search across multiple embedding spaces.

**Section-Level Embeddings**: Document sections are embedded using MiniLM-L6-v2 to generate 384-dimensional representations that capture semantic content while remaining computationally efficient for similarity search.

**Concept Embeddings**: Ontological concepts are embedded using the same model to ensure compatibility with section embeddings, enabling direct similarity computation between case content and professional ethics concepts.

**Hierarchical Indexing**: The pgvector database employs HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) indices that provide logarithmic search complexity while maintaining high recall for similarity queries.

## Document Processing Pipeline

The implementation includes comprehensive document processing capabilities that transform unstructured case content into semantically annotated, searchable representations.

**Structure Annotation Pipeline**: Documents undergo automatic analysis using a combination of rule-based pattern recognition and machine learning classification to identify semantic sections according to BFO principles.

**Entity Recognition and Linking**: Professional entities mentioned in case content are identified using domain-specific named entity recognition models and linked to corresponding ontological representations.

**Triple Generation**: Identified entities and relationships are formalized as RDF triples and integrated into the world-specific ontological knowledge base.

## Multi-Metric Relevance Calculation System

The implementation provides comprehensive relevance scoring that combines multiple similarity metrics through configurable weighting schemes.

**Vector Similarity Computation**: Cosine similarity is computed efficiently using pgvector's built-in operators, with optional normalization and threshold filtering to improve score distributions.

**Term Overlap Analysis**: TF-IDF weighted Jaccard similarity is computed using optimized text processing pipelines that include lemmatization, stopword removal, and domain-specific vocabulary enhancement.

**Structural Relevance Assessment**: Ontological relationship analysis employs graph traversal algorithms to assess concept relationships and compute relevance based on semantic distance within the knowledge hierarchy.

**LLM Enhancement Integration**: Optional LLM-based relevance assessment provides complementary analysis that captures semantic relationships not reflected in vector or lexical similarity metrics.

## REST/JSON-RPC Interface Design

The system exposes functionality through standardized web APIs that enable integration with external systems and support for distributed deployment scenarios.

**World Management APIs**: Endpoints for creating, updating, and querying domain-specific ethical frameworks, including ontology upload, concept extraction, and relationship management.

**Case Analysis APIs**: Services for case upload, structural annotation, similarity search, and reasoning workflow execution with comprehensive result formatting and metadata provision.

**Reasoning APIs**: Interfaces for constraint-based reasoning, precedent retrieval, and ontological validation with support for both synchronous and asynchronous processing modes.

## Ontology Access and Navigation

The implementation provides sophisticated ontology management capabilities that support both automated reasoning and interactive exploration.

**Concept Hierarchy Navigation**: APIs for traversing ontological hierarchies, retrieving concept definitions, and exploring relationship networks with support for graph visualization and analysis.

**Constraint Query Processing**: Specialized query engines for evaluating logical constraints, identifying applicable principles, and determining obligation scope within specific contexts.

**Triple Pattern Matching**: SPARQL-compatible query processing for complex pattern matching across RDF knowledge bases with optimization for common professional ethics query patterns.

## Bidirectional Validation Workflow

The system implements comprehensive validation mechanisms that ensure reasoning consistency with professional ethical frameworks while maintaining computational efficiency.

**Input Validation**: Ontological constraints are systematically applied to LLM inputs through context injection and prompt engineering that incorporates relevant professional obligations and precedent patterns.

**Output Validation**: Generated reasoning undergoes automatic validation against professional ethics constraints using logical consistency checking and precedent comparison analysis.

**Conflict Resolution**: When validation identifies conflicts between LLM outputs and ontological constraints, the system provides detailed conflict analysis and resolution strategies based on professional framework priorities.

## Performance and Scalability Considerations

The implementation addresses performance requirements for both research experimentation and practical deployment scenarios.

**Caching Strategies**: Frequently accessed ontological concepts and computed similarity scores are cached using Redis to reduce database load and improve response times.

**Parallel Processing**: Embedding generation and similarity computation employ parallel processing techniques to leverage multi-core architectures and reduce processing latency.

**Index Optimization**: Database indices are optimized for common query patterns including similarity search, concept lookup, and precedent retrieval with periodic maintenance and performance monitoring.

## Modular Component Architecture

The implementation employs a modular design that enables independent development, testing, and deployment of system components while maintaining clear interface contracts.

**Service Isolation**: Each major system component operates as an independent service with defined API boundaries, enabling distributed deployment and independent scaling.

**Configuration Management**: System behavior is controlled through comprehensive configuration files that specify component parameters, threshold values, and integration settings without requiring code modification.

**Extension Points**: The architecture provides clear extension points for adding new professional domains, integrating additional similarity metrics, and incorporating alternative LLM backends.

The implementation architecture provides a robust, scalable foundation for ontology-constrained ethical reasoning that supports both current research requirements and future extension to additional professional domains and deployment scenarios.
