# Section 2.3 LLM-Based Moral Reasoning - Enhanced with Validated Citations

## Enhanced Section 2.3 

**Note**: This section focuses on systems that use LLMs to assist with ethical reasoning and moral decision-making, rather than approaches for making AI systems themselves more ethical (e.g., Constitutional AI, alignment research). ProEthica belongs to the former category - using AI as a tool for ethical deliberation rather than addressing the ethics of AI use.

### Recent Advances in AI-Human Alignment for Ethical Decision-Making
Contemporary research has moved beyond standalone LLM moral reasoning toward systems that align with human decision-makers in specific professional contexts. Molineaux et al. (2024) present a significant advance in aligning AI systems to human decision-makers in military medical triage scenarios. Their work demonstrates how case-based reasoning can be integrated with AI systems to support ethical decision-making in high-stakes professional contexts, where decisions must align with both explicit protocols and expert judgment patterns.

The Molineaux et al. (2024) approach is particularly relevant to professional ethics applications because it addresses the challenge of aligning AI reasoning with human expertise in domain-specific ethical contexts. Their work in medical triage scenarios shows how AI systems can be designed to support rather than replace human ethical judgment, providing decision support that respects the complexity and context-dependency of professional ethical decision-making.

### Limitations of Current LLM-Based Approaches
Current LLM-based moral reasoning systems face several key limitations that ProEthica aims to address:

1. **Lack of Professional Grounding**: Most systems treat ethical reasoning as general text generation rather than specialized professional decision support grounded in domain-specific obligations and precedents.

2. **Insufficient Constraint Mechanisms**: Existing approaches lack formal mechanisms to ensure that AI reasoning aligns with established professional ethical frameworks and precedent cases.

3. **Limited Precedent Integration**: While systems like those described by Molineaux et al. (2024) incorporate case-based approaches, they do not systematically integrate the rich precedent-based reasoning that characterizes established professional ethics domains.

4. **Weak Bidirectional Validation**: Current systems typically generate moral reasoning without systematic post-hoc validation against professional ethical frameworks and established precedent patterns.

### The Need for Ontology-Constrained Approaches
Recent advances in using large language models for moral decision-making and ethical evaluation demonstrate both the potential and limitations of current approaches. While LLMs show remarkable capability in generating contextually appropriate ethical reasoning, they lack the structured constraint mechanisms needed for professional contexts where decisions must be traceable to specific ethical principles and precedent cases.

The integration of ontological knowledge structures with LLM reasoning capabilities, as proposed in ProEthica, addresses these limitations by providing both constraint mechanisms during reasoning and validation frameworks for generated outputs. This approach builds on the foundation established by systems like SIROCCO (McLaren, 2003) and recent alignment work (Molineaux et al., 2024) while addressing their limitations through bidirectional LLM-ontology integration.
