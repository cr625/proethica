# 3.1 Requirements for Ontology-Constrained Ethical Reasoning

**Table: Mapping Ethical Reasoning Needs to ProEthica Components**

| Ethical Reasoning Need | Why Needed | ProEthica Component |
|------------------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Role-based obligations** | Professional ethics requires domain-specific duties | Role-based ontologies with professional codes extract and formalize duties from canonical ethics documents |
| **Domain specialization** | Different professions have unique ethical frameworks | World-based organization with canonical guidelines for each professional domain |
| **Analogical reasoning** | Legal/ethical precedents inform decisions | Multi-metric relevance scoring combining vector similarity, term overlap, structural relevance, and LLM enhancement |
| **Structured case analysis** | Systematic evaluation prevents oversight | Structured decomposition with document structure annotation |
| **Transparent justification** | Ethical decisions must be explainable | Ontology-constrained prompting with traceable references to specific ethical principles |
| **Bidirectional validation** | LLM outputs must be checked against ethical principles | Ontological admissibility checking validates reasoning against professional frameworks |
| **Constraint enforcement** | LLMs need guidance, not autonomy | Two-way integration: ontology guides LLM input, validates LLM output |
| **Precedent retrieval** | Similar cases inform current decisions | Section-level embedding similarity enables component-specific precedent matching |
| **Professional grounding** | Ethics varies by domain/role | Domain-specific ontology extensions with formalized professional codes |
