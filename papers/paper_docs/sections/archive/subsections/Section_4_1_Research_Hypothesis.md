# 4.1 Research Hypothesis

ProEthica's ontology-constrained approach to ethical reasoning represents a systematic method for grounding LLM outputs in professional ethical frameworks. The research hypothesis centers on whether structured ontological constraints improve the quality and alignment of ethical reasoning compared to standard retrieval-augmented approaches.

## Primary Hypothesis

**Ontology-constrained prompts that integrate role-based ethical obligations with structured case precedents will produce more reasonable, persuasive, and aligned ethical reasoning compared to standard retrieval-augmented baseline approaches.**

This hypothesis addresses the fundamental question of whether systematic integration of professional ethics knowledge through ontological structures enhances LLM reasoning capabilities beyond general similarity-based retrieval methods.

## Specific Predictions

The research framework tests four key dimensions of ethical reasoning improvement.

**Reasoning Quality Enhancement**: ProEthica outputs will demonstrate superior logical coherence, systematic principle application, and structured argumentation compared to baseline approaches. The ontological constraints are expected to guide reasoning toward more systematic consideration of relevant ethical factors.

**Persuasiveness Improvement**: Participants will find ProEthica-generated reasoning more convincing and well-supported than baseline outputs. The structured integration of precedent cases and professional principles should enhance the persuasive quality of ethical arguments.

**Conclusion Accuracy**: ProEthica predictions will show higher alignment with original NSPE Board determinations. The systematic application of professional ethical principles should improve prediction accuracy for expert ethical reasoning.

**Professional Alignment**: ProEthica outputs will demonstrate better adherence to professional ethical reasoning patterns and standards. The ontological grounding should produce reasoning that more closely matches established professional ethics practices.

## Evaluation Framework

The evaluation approach employs comparative assessment where participants evaluate paired outputs across multiple dimensions. Participants do not know which system generated each output (ProEthica vs. baseline). This double-blind comparative approach enables direct assessment of reasoning quality differences.

**Participant-Based Assessment**: Non-expert participants evaluate reasoning quality, persuasiveness, and preference between system outputs. This approach avoids potential conflicts of interest with expert reviewers while providing generalizable assessments of reasoning quality.

**Alignment Measurement**: System predictions are compared directly against original NSPE Board conclusions to assess accuracy and professional alignment. This provides objective validation of the approach's effectiveness in professional ethics contexts.

**Multi-Dimensional Evaluation**: The framework assesses both content quality (reasoning coherence, principle application) and outcome accuracy (conclusion prediction). This provides comprehensive evaluation of the ontology-constrained approach.

## Methodological Approach

The research design implements a leave-one-out cross-validation approach on NSPE Board of Ethical Review cases, enabling systematic assessment of prediction accuracy while maintaining independence between training and evaluation data.

**Case-Based Evaluation**: Each of the 20 NSPE cases serves as a test case with conclusion and discussion sections redacted, requiring the system to predict these elements based on facts and applicable ethical principles.

**Comparative Analysis**: For each test case, both ProEthica and baseline systems generate predictions, enabling direct comparison of reasoning quality and accuracy.

**Structured Assessment**: Participants evaluate three comparison types: conclusion-only, discussion-only, and combined conclusion-discussion comparisons, providing comprehensive assessment of different reasoning components.

The hypothesis testing framework enables systematic evaluation of whether ontological constraints meaningfully improve ethical reasoning quality while maintaining practical applicability for professional ethics applications.
