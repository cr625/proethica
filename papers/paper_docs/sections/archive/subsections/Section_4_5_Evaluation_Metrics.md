# 4.5 Evaluation Metrics

The evaluation framework employs multiple complementary metrics to assess the effectiveness of ontology-constrained ethical reasoning across different dimensions of quality and accuracy. The metrics balance objective measures with subjective assessments to provide comprehensive evaluation of system performance.

## Participant-Based Assessment Metrics

**Reasoning Quality Assessment**: Participants evaluate the logical coherence and systematic nature of ethical reasoning using a 7-point Likert scale. This metric captures whether arguments follow clear logical progression, appropriately apply ethical principles, and address relevant considerations systematically.

**Persuasiveness Rating**: Subjective assessment of argument convincingness on a 7-point scale. Participants indicate which reasoning they find more compelling and convincing, providing insight into practical effectiveness of different approaches for ethical communication.

**Clarity and Accessibility**: Evaluation of reasoning comprehensibility for non-expert audiences. This metric assesses whether ethical arguments are presented in accessible language with clear explanations of principle application and reasoning steps.

**Overall Preference**: Direct comparative preference between paired system outputs. Participants select which reasoning they consider superior overall, providing a comprehensive quality assessment that integrates multiple factors.

## Accuracy and Alignment Metrics

**Conclusion Accuracy**: Binary assessment of whether system predictions match or contradict original NSPE Board conclusions. This provides objective measurement of professional alignment and prediction accuracy.

**Reasoning Pattern Alignment**: Assessment of whether system reasoning follows similar patterns and considerations as original NSPE analysis. This captures qualitative aspects of professional reasoning beyond simple conclusion agreement.

**Principle Application Accuracy**: Evaluation of whether systems correctly identify and apply relevant NSPE Code provisions. This metric assesses the accuracy of ethical principle selection and application within specific case contexts.

## Comparative Performance Metrics

**Preference Percentage**: Proportion of cases where participants prefer ProEthica outputs over baseline outputs across different evaluation conditions. This metric provides clear quantitative assessment of relative system performance.

**Effect Size Calculation**: Cohen's d calculation for Likert scale differences between systems, providing standardized measurement of performance difference magnitude beyond statistical significance.

**Consistency Measures**: Inter-participant agreement rates and response consistency within participants across similar cases. This assesses the reliability and stability of evaluation metrics.

## Condition-Specific Metrics

**Conclusion Prediction Performance**: 
- Accuracy rate for conclusion matching
- Participant preference for predicted vs. original conclusions  
- Reasoning quality ratings for conclusion justification

**Discussion Analysis Performance**:
- Coherence ratings for reasoning process
- Completeness assessment for consideration of relevant factors
- Clarity ratings for argument presentation

**Integrated Analysis Performance**:
- Overall coherence of combined reasoning and conclusion
- Consistency between discussion analysis and final conclusion
- Comprehensive quality assessment for complete ethical reasoning

## Statistical Analysis Framework

**Significance Testing**: Chi-square tests for preference distributions, t-tests for Likert scale differences, and Mann-Whitney U tests for non-parametric comparisons ensure robust statistical evaluation.

**Confidence Intervals**: 95% confidence intervals for all effect estimates provide reliable bounds for performance differences and enable meaningful interpretation of results.

**Multiple Comparison Correction**: Bonferroni correction or similar methods address multiple testing concerns when evaluating across different conditions and metrics simultaneously.

## Qualitative Assessment Integration

**Open-Ended Feedback Analysis**: Thematic analysis of participant comments identifies specific strengths and weaknesses in reasoning approaches, providing insights for system improvement and understanding evaluation results.

**Pattern Recognition**: Systematic analysis of which types of cases show strongest performance differences, enabling identification of conditions where ontological constraints provide greatest benefit.

**Error Analysis**: Examination of cases where systems perform poorly or show unexpected results, providing insights into approach limitations and improvement opportunities.

## Validity and Reliability Measures

**Internal Consistency**: Cronbach's alpha for multi-item scales and test-retest reliability for subset of participants ensure measurement reliability.

**Construct Validity**: Factor analysis of evaluation dimensions confirms that metrics capture intended aspects of reasoning quality and are not confounded by irrelevant factors.

**External Validity**: Comparison of participant preferences with expert assessments (where available) validates that non-expert evaluations align with professional quality judgments.

The evaluation framework provides comprehensive assessment of ontology-constrained reasoning effectiveness while maintaining practical implementation feasibility and statistical rigor for reliable conclusions about approach benefits.
