# 3.4 Analogical Reasoning and Precedent Handling

ProEthica implements analogical reasoning through a multi-metric relevance scoring system. The system combines vector similarity, lexical overlap, structural relationships, and LLM-enhanced assessment to identify relevant precedent cases and ethical principles. This approach addresses the core challenge of case-based reasoning in professional ethics. The challenge involves determining which past cases and ethical principles are most applicable to a current situation.

## Multi-Metric Relevance Calculation

The system employs four complementary metrics to calculate relevance between case sections and ontological concepts. Each metric captures different aspects of similarity.

**Vector Similarity (40% weight)**: The system uses 384-dimensional embeddings from MiniLM-L6-v2 to compute cosine similarity between section content and ontology concepts. The similarity undergoes sigmoid normalization to improve score distribution.

$r_{vector} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-10(\cos(\vec{s},\vec{c}) - 0.5)}}$

In this equation, $\vec{s}$ represents the section embedding and $\vec{c}$ represents the concept embedding.

**Term Overlap (25% weight)**: The system calculates TF-IDF weighted Jaccard similarity between preprocessed text content. The calculation is enhanced with lemmatization and stopword removal to capture lexical relationships beyond simple vector similarity.

**Structural Relevance (20% weight)**: The system leverages ontological relationships and document structure to assess relevance based on section type and concept category. Obligation concepts receive higher relevance scores when associated with "rules" sections. Event concepts are prioritized for "facts" sections.

**LLM Enhancement (15% weight)**: The system employs direct LLM assessment to evaluate conceptual relevance through natural language understanding. This provides a complementary perspective that captures nuanced relationships not reflected in the other metrics.

The final relevance score combines these metrics using a confidence-weighted approach.

$R_{combined} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot r_i$

Weights are dynamically adjusted when certain metrics are unavailable. This ensures robust scoring across varied scenarios.

## Section-Level Case Analysis and Retrieval

The system performs analysis at the document section level rather than treating entire cases as monolithic units. Each section (Facts, Issues, Rules, Analysis, Conclusion) is embedded separately and stored in a pgvector database. This enables targeted retrieval of relevant precedent components.

Document sections undergo structured annotation to identify their semantic role within the ethical reasoning framework. This enables the system to match Facts sections with factual precedents, Rules sections with applicable principles, and Analysis sections with similar reasoning patterns from past cases.

## Precedent Matching and Analogical Reasoning

Precedent identification follows a two-phase process combining coarse-grained and fine-grained matching. Initial filtering uses vector similarity to identify potentially relevant cases. Detailed multi-metric assessment then ranks precedents by relevance strength.

The system implements analogical reasoning by identifying structural parallels between current and precedent cases. Key elements include the following.

**Factual Pattern Matching**: The system identifies cases with similar factual circumstances, professional roles, and contextual factors.

**Ethical Principle Application**: The system matches cases where similar professional obligations and ethical principles were applied or considered.

**Outcome Pattern Analysis**: The system considers precedent cases with comparable resolutions. The analysis particularly focuses on how ethical principles were prioritized when conflicts arose.

## Dynamic Threshold Determination

The system employs statistical analysis to dynamically adjust relevance thresholds based on score distributions rather than using fixed similarity thresholds. When scores are tightly clustered, the threshold uses mean minus half standard deviation. For widely distributed scores, the system applies the 70th percentile as the relevance threshold.

Section-specific thresholds account for the varying nature of different document components. Rules sections require higher precision (threshold 0.65) while Facts sections use more permissive matching (threshold 0.55).

## Contradiction Identification and Resolution

The system actively identifies conflicting precedents where similar factual situations led to different ethical conclusions. When contradictions are detected, the system employs ethical priority mapping to explain divergences. The system provides resolution strategies based on several factors.

**Professional Framework Validation**: The system checks whether conflicts arise from evolving professional standards or different interpretational approaches within the ethical framework.

**Contextual Factor Analysis**: The system identifies subtle factual or contextual differences that may explain apparently contradictory outcomes.

**Temporal Considerations**: The system accounts for changes in professional codes or societal ethical standards over time.

## Integration with Ontological Constraints

The analogical reasoning system operates within the constraints established by the professional ethics ontology. Retrieved precedents must align with current professional obligations and cannot contradict fundamental ethical principles encoded in the ontology.

This constraint mechanism ensures that analogical reasoning supports rather than undermines the systematic application of professional ethical standards. The mechanism maintains consistency between case-based reasoning and principle-based obligations.

The analogical reasoning system provides the foundation for contextualizing current ethical dilemmas within the broader framework of professional precedent. The system maintains adherence to established ethical principles and obligations.

## Integration with Prediction Pipeline

The multi-metric relevance calculation system serves as the foundation for the ProEthica prediction pipeline currently under development. This pipeline will enable systematic prediction of case outcomes and discussion analysis based on precedent patterns and ontological constraints. The pipeline will provide empirical validation of the ontology-constrained reasoning approach through leave-one-out evaluation on NSPE cases.
