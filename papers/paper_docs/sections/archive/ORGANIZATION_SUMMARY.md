# Section Organization Summary
**Date**: May 23, 2025  
**Task**: Reorganized paper sections according to new "one file per section" approach

## Current Section Structure (Clean Organization)

### ‚úÖ **Complete Sections (One File Each)**
1. **Section_1_Introduction.md** - Complete and comprehensive
2. **Section_2_Background.md** - Complete with integrated related work  
3. **Section_3_Proposed_Approach.md** - Complete with all subsections integrated
4. **Section_4_Study.md** - Complete methodology section
5. **Section_5_Results.md** - Placeholder (to be completed after study)
6. **Section_6_Discussion.md** - Placeholder (to be completed after results)
7. **Section_7_Conclusion.md** - Complete

### üìÅ **Archived Content**
- **`/archive/subsections/`**: All individual subsection files moved here
  - Section 2 subsections (2.1, 2.2, 2.3 variations)
  - Section 3 subsections (3.1-3.6 with revisions)  
  - Section 4 subsections (4.1-4.6)
- **`/archive/`**: Duplicate and alternative versions
  - Previous Section 1 versions
  - Related Work as separate section
  - Various placeholders

## Content Integration Status

### ‚úÖ **Successfully Integrated**
- **Section 1**: All introduction content consolidated
- **Section 2**: Background integrates computational ethics, prior systems, LLM moral reasoning, and related work  
- **Section 3**: Requirements table, conceptual framework, concrete example, and technical implementation all integrated
- **Section 4**: Complete study methodology with all subsections integrated
- **Section 7**: Complete conclusion content

### ‚è≥ **To Be Completed**
- **Section 5 (Results)**: Awaiting empirical study completion
- **Section 6 (Discussion)**: Awaiting results for interpretation

## Key Organizational Decisions

1. **Related Work Integration**: Related work was integrated into Section 2 (Background) rather than maintained as separate section, following the complete draft pattern
2. **Subsection Preservation**: All individual subsection content preserved in archive for reference
3. **FINAL File Renaming**: Removed "_FINAL" suffixes for clean naming
4. **Master Outline Alignment**: Structure matches ProEthica_Structure_Outline_MASTER.md

## File Naming Convention
- Pattern: `Section_X_Title.md` (no subsection numbers)
- Clean, consistent naming across all sections
- Archived files retain original names for traceability

## Next Steps
1. ‚úÖ Section organization complete
2. ‚è≥ Complete empirical study for Section 5
3. ‚è≥ Write Section 6 discussion based on results
4. ‚è≥ Final integration and review

---

**Result**: Successfully transitioned from multiple subsection files to single comprehensive files per section while preserving all content in organized archives.
