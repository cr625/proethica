# Section 2 Background - Previous Version (Before Problem/Gap Alignment)

**Date**: May 23, 2025
**Status**: Archived - Replaced by revised version focused on professional ethics alignment

This file contains the original consolidated Section 2 before revision for better alignment with problem context and gap analysis. The revised version removes general moral reasoning content and focuses specifically on professional ethics applications.

**Key Changes Made in Revision**:
- Removed general LLM moral reasoning content not relevant to professional contexts
- Added explicit focus on professional domains (medicine, engineering, law)
- Streamlined content to directly support the three identified gaps
- Enhanced positioning of limitations in existing systems
- Focused evaluation methodologies on professional domain requirements

[Original content was comprehensive but included too much general moral reasoning content that didn't directly support our professional ethics focus. The revised version maintains the strong theoretical foundations while being more targeted to our specific problem context.]
