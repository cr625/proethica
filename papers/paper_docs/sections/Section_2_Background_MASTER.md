# 2. Background and Related Work

## 2.1 Computational Ethics and Role Theory

Computational ethics represents efforts to translate ethical theory into machine-operable representations for decision support in professional domains. However, this translation faces significant computational complexity challenges, as the tractability of ethical reasoning problems varies substantially across different normative frameworks \cite{stenseke2024computational}. This field has evolved from early rule-based systems to sophisticated approaches that recognize the complexity and context-dependency of professional ethical obligations \cite{tolmeijer2021implementations,prem_ethical_2023}. Professional ethics differs fundamentally from general moral reasoning in that it operates within established institutional frameworks, codes of conduct, and precedent-based decision patterns that characterize domains such as medicine, engineering, and law.

Role-based ethics emphasizes duty tied to social and professional roles rather than universal moral principles \cite{johnson2014role}. This approach is particularly relevant for professional contexts where individuals must navigate between personal moral standards and institutional obligations. \citet{cooper2023role} demonstrate this tension in professional purchasing decisions, showing how felt responsibility varies significantly based on role interpretation within professional frameworks. Professional ethics operates through domain-specific obligations that vary by role responsibilities and institutional context, requiring artificial moral agents to navigate contextual variation in professional frameworks \cite{wallach2009moral}. This contextual variation makes role-based ethics particularly suitable for computational modeling where domain-specific ethical frameworks must capture both explicit professional codes and implicit precedent-based reasoning patterns \cite{wallach2009moral}.

Professional ethical reasoning fundamentally relies on case-based reasoning (CBR) following the principle of treating like cases alike \cite{ashley1995cbr}. Ashley and McLaren's foundational work on CBR knowledge representation for practical ethics established that professional ethical reasoning involves comparative evaluation of problems rather than deductive application of abstract principles. Their approach recognizes that professional ethical principles often have inconsistent or poorly defined antecedents, making pure deductive reasoning insufficient for complex professional decisions. The CBR approach is essential in professional domains where abstract ethical principles must be applied to concrete factual scenarios within established institutional frameworks. Professional practitioners routinely construct ethical arguments by comparing current problems to past paradigmatic cases, implementing bottom-up decision-making that complements top-down principle-based approaches while remaining grounded in professional precedent.

## 2.2 Prior Systems for Professional Ethics

Early computational approaches to professional ethics established foundational frameworks for specific domains. SIROCCO represents the most directly relevant precedent, as \citet{mclaren2003extensionally} computational model for extensionally defining principles and cases in ethics was specifically designed for case-based evaluative reasoning using NSPE engineering ethics cases. This system demonstrated the viability of computational approaches to professional ethical reasoning within established frameworks using the same case corpus employed in our evaluation. MedEthEx implemented domain-specific ethical modeling for medical decision support, incorporating Beauchamp and Childress' principles of biomedical ethics through inductive logic programming \cite{anderson2005medethex}. GenEth provided broader ethical dilemma analysis but lacked the domain-specific grounding needed for professional contexts \cite{anderson2018geneth}. These systems established that professional ethics applications require domain-specific knowledge representation rather than general moral reasoning frameworks.

Research on domain ontologies for professional ethics has focused on organizing professional codes, case precedents, and domain-specific frameworks rather than encoding universal ethical principles. The IEEE 7007-2021 Ontological Standard provides a framework for ethically driven robotics and automation systems, emphasizing domain-specific ontologies that include professional considerations such as data privacy, transparency, responsibility, and accountability tailored to cyber-physical systems \cite{ieee2021ontological,houghtaling2021applications,prestes2021framework}. The development of the Ontology of Professional Judicial Knowledge (OPJK) demonstrates how ontologies can represent complex professional knowledge for practical application in legal contexts \cite{casellas2011legal,sartor2011approaches}.

However, these approaches focus primarily on knowledge organization rather than constraint-based reasoning or precedent-based analogical comparison \cite{chhabra_evaluating_2024,contini_ai_2024}. Current ontological systems for professional ethics operate primarily as knowledge organization tools rather than constraint mechanisms for reasoning processes. They lack the bidirectional integration needed to both guide input reasoning and validate output consistency with professional frameworks. Most importantly, they do not support the analogical precedent matching that characterizes professional ethical decision-making \cite{ashley1995cbr}.

## 2.3 LLM Applications in Professional Contexts

LLMs are increasingly applied in professional contexts requiring ethical reasoning, including medical decision support \cite{haltaufderheide2024ethics,tierney2025health,roustan2025clinicians}, engineering consultation \cite{kampelopoulos2025review,ege2025chatgpt}, and legal analysis \cite{bent2023large,terzidou2025generative,peoples2025artificial}. However, these applications reveal significant limitations when professional obligations, institutional codes, and precedent-based reasoning must guide decision processes. Recent research has demonstrated that while LLMs can generate contextually appropriate professional advice, they lack structured mechanisms to ensure consistency with established professional frameworks \cite{alyousef2025ethical,benk2025bridging,duenas2024risks}. Current approaches to professional AI alignment require extensive domain-specific development and do not readily generalize across professional domains \cite{batarseh2024challenges,bommasani2024using}.

Current LLM applications in professional contexts face three critical limitations that directly correspond to the gaps identified in Section 1. First, professional contexts require adherence to specific codes, regulations, and institutional frameworks, but current LLMs cannot enforce these constraints during reasoning \cite{liu2024safeguarding,huang2024prompt}. While prompts may reference professional codes, there is no mechanism to verify consistency with those standards throughout the reasoning process \cite{carrell2023breakthrough,lee2024lawyer}. Second, professional ethics relies heavily on precedent comparison and analogical reasoning, but current LLM systems do not systematically integrate case precedents or support structured analogical comparison \cite{webb2023emergent,yasunaga2024large}. Even retrieval-augmented approaches typically provide context without enabling genuine analogical reasoning about case similarities and differences \cite{gao2024synergizing,liu2025much,agrawal2024mindful}. Third, professional contexts require both constraint-guided reasoning and post-hoc validation against professional frameworks. Current systems may apply some rules to input or postprocess output for compliance, but few systems provide bidirectional integration between constraint mechanisms and reasoning validation \cite{batarseh2021comprehensive,busuioc2021accountable}.

## 2.4 Evaluation Approaches for Professional Ethics Systems

Evaluation of AI systems for professional ethics requires methodologies that assess alignment with established professional frameworks rather than general moral reasoning capabilities. Recent work has explored precedent-based validation approaches that align more closely with professional decision-making patterns \cite{wiratunga2024cbr,sourati2023case}. Research on case-based moral judgment alignment demonstrates the value of precedent-based reasoning for professional applications where consistency with established case patterns is essential \cite{christou2024casegpt,hatalis2025review}.

Recent reviews of CBR-LLM integration propose advantages for professional reasoning contexts, including enhanced transparency through precedent-based justification and improved domain adaptation \cite{guo2024dsagent,hatalis2025review}. Evidence from medical triage and legal question answering shows that providing relevant case context improves both accuracy and user trust in professional applications \cite{wiratunga2024cbr}.

Despite advances in evaluation methodologies, current approaches demonstrate significant limitations for professional ethics applications \cite{batarseh2021comprehensive}. Most evaluation frameworks focus on general moral reasoning rather than alignment with specific professional codes and precedent patterns \cite{chhabra_evaluating_2024}. They typically assess output quality rather than reasoning process adherence to professional frameworks \cite{busuioc2021accountable}. Professional ethics evaluation requires assessment of reasoning consistency with established codes, appropriateness of precedent selection, and traceability of decisions to professional frameworks. Current evaluation approaches do not systematically address these professional-specific requirements, limiting their applicability to professional ethics systems. The absence of bidirectional evaluation frameworks that assess both constraint application during reasoning and output validation against professional standards represents a critical gap in current methodologies. Professional contexts require evaluation approaches that can verify both the reasoning process and the final recommendations align with established professional frameworks and precedent patterns.
