# Updated Section-Triple Association Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the updated section-triple association system that directly uses ontology TTL files instead of database-stored triples.

## 1. Project Overview

The goal is to create a system that associates document sections with relevant ontology concepts from the enhanced engineering-ethics.ttl and proethica-intermediate.ttl files, with a focus on role-related concepts.

Key improvements over the previous approach:
- Direct use of ontology TTL files instead of database triples
- Leveraging semantic matching properties added to the ontology
- Context-aware matching based on section types
- Focus on role-related concepts and principles

## 2. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Component Development
1. [x] Create OntologyTripleLoader class
   - [x] Load TTL files directly with rdflib
   - [x] Extract concepts with semantic properties
   - [x] Prioritize role-related concepts
   - [x] Clean text for embedding generation

2. [x] Develop embedding service
   - [x] Generate embeddings for sections and concepts
   - [x] Compute similarity metrics
   - [x] Handle text cleaning to avoid formatting tokens

3. [x] Implement two-phase matching algorithm
   - [x] Coarse matching with vector similarity
   - [x] Fine-grained matching with semantic properties
   - [x] Section type context awareness

4. [x] Create storage mechanism
   - [x] Define table structure for associations
   - [x] Implement storage and retrieval functions

### Phase 2: Integration and Testing
1. [x] Build main service class
   - [x] Bring components together
   - [x] Connect to database for section access
   - [x] Implement batch processing

2. [x] Develop command-line interface
   - [x] Process flags for different modes
   - [x] Support section selection options
   - [x] Provide progress reporting

3. [âœ“] Create comprehensive testing scripts
   - [x] Test ontology loading
   - [ ] Test with sample document
   - [ ] Benchmark performance

### Phase 3: UI Integration and Refinement
1. [ ] Update web interface
   - [ ] Display associated concepts
   - [ ] Filter by concept type
   - [ ] Show match confidence

2. [ ] Develop evaluation tools
   - [ ] Compare with previous approach
   - [ ] Manual review interface
   - [ ] Gather metrics on match quality

## 4. Key Component Details

### OntologyTripleLoader
```python
class OntologyTripleLoader:
    def __init__(self, ontology_files=None):
        """
        Initialize with optional ontology file paths, otherwise use defaults.
        
        Args:
            ontology_files: List of paths to .ttl files to load
        """
        if ontology_files is None:
            # Default to the standard ontology files
            self.ontology_files = [
                "ontologies/proethica-intermediate.ttl",
                "ontologies/engineering-ethics.ttl"
            ]
        else:
            self.ontology_files = ontology_files
            
        self.graph = None
        self.concepts = {}
        self.role_concepts = {}
        self.role_related_concepts = {}
        
    def load(self):
        """Load ontologies from .ttl files into an RDFLib graph."""
        # Load ontology files
        # Extract concepts and properties
        
    def get_concept_text_for_embedding(self, concept_uri):
        """Get clean text representation of concept for embedding."""
        # Create text combining label, description, and matching terms
        # Remove formatting tokens and technical syntax
```

### SectionTripleAssociator
```python
class SectionTripleAssociator:
    def __init__(self, ontology_loader, embedding_service, 
                 similarity_threshold=0.6, max_matches=10):
        """Initialize the associator with components and parameters."""
        # Initialize components and parameters
        # Generate concept embeddings
        
    def associate_section(self, section_embedding, section_metadata):
        """
        Associate a section with relevant ontology concepts.
        
        Args:
            section_embedding: Vector embedding of the section
            section_metadata: Metadata about the section
            
        Returns:
            List of match dictionaries with scores and metadata
        """
        # Two-phase matching process
        # Return ranked list of matching concepts
        
    def _get_section_context(self, section_metadata):
        """Extract contextual information about the section from structure triples."""
        # Determine section type and assign appropriate boosts
        # Return context object for fine-grained matching
```

### Main Service Integration
```python
class SectionTripleAssociationService:
    def __init__(self, similarity_threshold=0.6, max_matches=10):
        """Initialize the service with components and parameters."""
        # Initialize loader, embedding service, and associator
        # Set up database connection
        
    def associate_section_with_concepts(self, section_id):
        """Associate a document section with relevant ontology concepts."""
        # Get section embedding and metadata
        # Perform association
        # Store results
        
    def batch_associate_sections(self, section_ids, batch_size=50):
        """Process multiple sections in batch."""
        # Process sections in batches
        # Track progress and results
```

## 5. Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for each component
   - Test ontology loading
   - Test embedding generation
   - Test matching algorithms

2. Integration tests
   - End-to-end processing of sample document
   - Verify database storage and retrieval

3. Regression tests
   - Ensure existing functionality is preserved
   - Compare with previous implementation

## 6. Success Criteria

1. All case sections successfully associated with relevant ontology concepts
2. Role-related concepts correctly prioritized in matching
3. Match quality verified through manual review
4. Processing completes within reasonable time and resource limits
5. Web interface properly displays concept associations
