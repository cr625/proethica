# LLM Experimental Framework and Evaluation

## Extensional Definition Experiment

### Research Questions
1. Can LLMs identify relevant principles using extensional definitions?
2. Do LLMs resolve conflicts consistently with expert consensus?
3. Does extensional approach improve over abstract descriptions?
4. Which operationalization techniques are most effectively modeled?

### Methodology

#### Dataset Structure
**Training Set**: 25 NSPE cases with:
- Principle instantiations
- Conflict resolutions
- Operationalization techniques
- Expert consensus decisions

**Test Set**: 
- 5 NSPE cases (held out)
- 3 novel scenarios

#### Experimental Conditions
1. **Baseline**: Abstract principle definitions only
2. **Extensional**: Access to principle examples from cases
3. **Ontology-Enhanced**: Extensional + structured ontology knowledge

### Evaluation Metrics

#### Principle Identification
- Precision: Correct identifications / Total identified
- Recall: Correct identifications / Actually applicable
- F1 score: Harmonic mean

#### Conflict Resolution
- Agreement rate with experts
- Reasoning pattern similarity
- Operationalization technique usage

#### Decision Quality
- Justification richness (relevant facts cited)
- Precedent case usage
- Professional standard alignment

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Current State
- Basic triple generation implemented
- Section embedding system operational
- LLM integration framework in place

### Phase 2: Enhancement (4 weeks)
- Week 1: LLM prompt design and testing framework
- Week 2: Implement enhanced generation and integration
- Week 3: Add filtering, quality control, ontology alignment
- Week 4: Testing, benchmarking, documentation

### Phase 3: Future Directions
- Multi-ontology alignment
- Interactive triple refinement
- Temporal and causal reasoning
- Contradiction detection

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- Caching for similar concept sets
- Batching for reduced API calls
- Appropriate timeouts for LLM operations
- Context window management

### Error Handling
- Mock data fallbacks
- Clear error reporting
- Graceful degradation
- Validation checks on LLM output
